# Sarcasm-Detection

Sarcasm is an ironic or satirical remark tempered by humor.Sarcasm is a figure of speech or speech comment which is extremely difficult to define. It is a statement or comment which means the opposite of what it says. It may be made with the intent of humour, or it may be made to be hurtful.Sarcasm is all about the context and tone of voice, which is why it works better verbally. It's something you'll know when you hear it.

### **Objective**
Detecting sarcastic text with an idea to better perceive human social interaction and understand how it plays an important role in both social and personal life. From the available twitter dataset, the goal is to predict whether a given tweet is sarcastic or not. Our dataset contains two columns â€“ Class (type: int64): contains 0(for nonsarcastic text) and 1(for sarcastic text) & Tweet (Text or Varchar). 

### **Outcome**
To solve the sentiment analysis, various NLP models were applied and there by classifying the tweets in different ways instead of just literal values (positive and negative) but also positively funny or negatively nasty.
