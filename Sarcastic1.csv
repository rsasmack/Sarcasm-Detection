"""Because you speeding does not directly result in a crash statistically.  Its hard to directly say that the act of going over the speed limit is what causes the crashes.  The US DOT did a study on data between 2005 and 2007 that found 8.4% of all crashes were because the driver was driving ""too fast for conditions"", and another 4.9% were ""too fast for curve"". (http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/us-crashcause.pdf)  Neither of which can be considered outright speeding, so the percentage of crashes due to simply going over the speed limit is even below that (a virginia study found it to be about 2.9% in their state - http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/va-crash07.pdf).    Now one could say, ""Well its more than 0% so its worth enforcing a speed limit.""  And I agree that there needs to be some sort of limit, but it needs to be a speed which is correct for the road.  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, would you not say the speed limit is too slow for the road?  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, that means 10% isnt which is really the majority cause of these speed related crashes, difference of speed of those involved.  So if the majority of traffic is going over the speed limit, do we limit the majority of people and continue to write tickets to those who dont obey, or do we raise the speed limit to prevent drivers from going slower than the pack?  Well we continue to write tickets of course because its a great source of income for police departments! /s""",1

Arguably the 2 teams (Coast and Vulcun) could have been = in strength. Back then I was actually of the opinion that Vulcun was better than GGU, they just had to face TSM earlier than GGU did in the bracket... I don't even remember who GGU faced in semi's, but it wasn't nearly as bad as TSM, plus, Vulcun beat Curse just to get to the semis I think.  -edit Ok looking back, it's weird. Vulcun beats CLG, then beats Curse, then faces TSM in semi's... But Despite losing, Curse also plays GGU in the semis. WTF is this bracket??? GGU beats Dignitas, then beats Curse in Semi's and then faces TSM in the finals. Pretty similar paths, Vulcun had to play an extra set earlier for... reasons? wins 2 sets, then loses in a close set to TSM. GGU beats two teams in a a best of 3 then loses to TSM. Who was better? Too bad they never got a chance to play each other in the bracket, my money was on Vulcun easy. Jintae/Dude couldn't handle Mancloud/Xmithie, guarantee it.

The recession affected the European Union during 2000 and 2001 and the United States in 2002 and 2003. The UK, Canada and Australia avoided the recession, while Russia, a nation that did not experience prosperity during the 1990s, in fact began to recover from said situation.[citation needed] Japan's 1990s recession continued. This recession was predicted by economists, because the boom of the 1990s (accompanied by both low inflation and low unemployment) had already ceased in East Asia during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The recession wasn't as significant as either of the two previous worldwide recessions. Some economists in the United States object to characterizing it as a recession since there were no two consecutive quarters of negative growth.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_2000s_recession  It takes a real prophet to forecast economic cycles. /s""",1

I'm gonna go ahead and say less than Clifford.    &gt; Being top 10 in defense doesn't mean he doesn't plays undersized line ups that lost us 4th Q leads....  I remember line ups of Kemba/Roberts/PJ/Marv/maxiell every single person is undersized in that group.  Bottom line he subbed defense for offense in the 4th and that resulted in losses.  You have to deal the cards you're dealt.  We don't have a very tall team, so we're going to be playing undersized ball a lot.  I don't think the lineup you mentioned really saw that much floor time.  PJ didn't play very often.  When we did put that lineup (or variations of that lineup) on the court, it was to score points.  The team is much, much better at defense than offense.  More often than not the reasons why we lost games were due to offensive problems rather than defensive problems.  Roberts, PJ, and Marvin are all better from 3 than the other guys at their positions (or at least were before Mo came).  They're still not good, but they're the best option to put points on the board.    &gt; Cliff foolishly stuck with his guns ... while our young players matured and needed more touches which they didn't get this year  1. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Clifford had no reason to go into the season with the assumption that Al would regress so much.  Had Al been healthy, the plan would have worked and we'd be in the playoffs.    2. Our team is built around Big Al on both offense and defense.  Our entire defensive strategy comes from a scheme Clifford devised to hide Al's weaknesses by focusing on team help D.  The players we signed were meant to compliment big Al (PJ, Marvin, Roberts, Mo, Lance, etc) and fit the system.    3. You can't easily change your identity mid- or late-season.  Players need time to learn new roles, new gameplans, and new schemes.  Making a radically new system is not something you can introduce overnight.  A lot of time, money, and talent is invested into the Big Al system (which has proven to be successful before).  When a tire goes flat on your car, the car naturally won't work as well as before.  That doesn't mean that you need to buy a new car, only get new tires.  We've had a lot of flats this year.  4. Which young players?  MKG got more playing time and lots more touches and shots on offense than ever before.  Zeller got loads more playing time and even became the regular starter.  I'm not sure you can honestly use PJ and ""matured"" yet in the same sentence.    &gt; He actually threw MKG under the bus very hard recently and it pissed me off.    ???? Clifford said [MKG might be Hornets most important player.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588732257600458752)  ""[He has a contagious competitiveness about him....When he wasn't on the floor I didn't like it](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733044938375168).""  [Clifford said the simplest measure of MKG's value is when he didn't play they didn't win.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733213343932418)  Yeah, Clifford *really* hates MKG.    /s""",1

Some may argue that since CHA and WIS apply to a similar number of skills but WIS also applies to Will saves, that makes it better. I refer those people to the feat found in totally-fair-and-not-broken-ACG which gives the Oracle Divine Grace, as the Paladin ability (add CHA to all saves in addition to their base stat), so lack of this option actually makes WIS *weaker* than CHA for the Oracle's purposes.  Another option is to play a Lore Shaman instead of a Lore Oracle. Aside from being WIS based out the gate, Lore Shaman gets a very good reason to grab a non-trivial INT score as well which feels appropriate here.

Theorists would identify the communist revolutions we've had, and argue that these were simply despots using rhetoric to forment peasant revolutions in their interests.  The masses are told this is communism, and the rhetoric (the Communist party of China, Communist Party of Cuba, etc) also plays along with that.  So I can either assign the theorists opinions I hear often from left anarchists, that all of these incarnations of so called communism aren't communism, or I can use the definition most people, the masses, the working class, would agree with.

They thought one of the main themes of the movie was that Love literally transcended space and time, which is obviously false and not what Interstellar was about.    The movie is a paradox within a paradox - Cooper fulfills the inner paradox when he sends the messages while in the tesseract, and future humans fulfill the outer paradox in some distant time when they have the technology to ""send back"" the black hole and wormhole and create the tesseract.  Future humans would have known it was something they needed to do because it already happened, in the same way Cooper did.  Of course, you either think this kind of paradox is possible or you think it's impossible (hence it being a paradox).  Either way, I think it's very interesting.    IMO, people who think the point of the movie is that *Love* transcends time and space are really missing a **huge** part of it.

For centuries the Marches on either side of the boundary was an area of mixed allegiances, **where families or clans switched which country or side they supported as suited their family interests at that time**, and lawlessness abounded. Before the personal union of the two kingdoms under James, **the border clans would switch allegiance between the Scottish and English crowns depending on what was most favourable for the members of the clan**. For a time a powerful local clan dominated a region on the border between England and Scotland. It was known as the Debatable Lands and neither monarch's writ was heeded.""

"""Considering the subject of this TIL, and many other threads, are about men suffering from the repercussions of false rape allegations, while their false-accusers go free without anything to resemble justice, I'd say the evidence begs to differ, and that yes, these cases are about Men suffering, as a demographic that face unfair consequences when falsely accused.  Let's count the ways society ""Does not fall over itself to help women"", shall we? We have Affirmative Action (Or as some call it in a solipsistic manner, ""Positive Discrimination"", as if there could be such a thing), we have the general aforementioned leniency in sentencing that you conveniently ignored, we have woman-only gyms and other ""Safe Spaces"" for women to congregate and socialize outside of interacting with men (While the same concept for men was demonized as sexist and discriminatory only a couple decades ago), and the ""Listen and Believe"" line being pushed on college campuses that has now led to a complete violation, yet again, of Title IX in their zealotry to ""Protect the Womynz"", which was done at their behest, I might add.  None of these benefits are extended to men. In fact, given the statistics on [health research alone,](http://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx) with research expenditures for Breast Cancer at $715 Million, Uterine Cancer at $40 Million, and Women's Health at a whopping total of $3,891,000,000 the amount spent on any field remotely benefitting men looks like a pittance, with Prostate Cancer at $284 Million, and absolutely zilch, zip, nada for either Testicular Cancer or Men's Health. We are largely left to fend for ourselves in the private sector for our healthcare research, which if you are familiar with anything in regards to research and funding, depending on private backers only means research is agonizingly slow without public funds. When the grand total of public healthcare costs in major gender-specific health issues ($4,576,000,000 for women, versus $40,000,000 for men) do not even come down to men even getting 1% of what is spent on women's health issues, and yet you claim that ""Society does not fall over itself to help women"", it makes it perfectly clear who the ignorant one here is.  Edit: Oh, wow...this is rich. I never expected somebody that let their subjectivity influence their arguments so badly would be a Teacher! I was expecting some fast-food worker or perhaps a Women's Studies major.

I described the two tiered analysis of rational basis and strict scrutiny that is present in the US cases.  It basically determines the result--if a law only needs a rational basis, it will be held to be constitutional; if a law must be justified under strict scrutiny (a compelling state interest accomplished using the least intrusive means available) the laws are generally unconstitutional.  There have been two outliers--Japanese internment camps and travel to Cuba where laws have survived strict scrutiny.  The US paid reparations for the former and history will judge us poorly for the latter.  Where a law disproportionately impacts either a fundamental right or a ""suspect"" class (race, color, religion, national origin, sex, familial status, and in some states sexual orientation) the courts will use strict scrutiny and all these laws appear doomed.

"""Okay so I'm into the 9/11 conspiracy. I'm not going to say some ""irrefutable evidence"" or whatever. My personal opinion is that there were too many fucked up things that happened that day, and it seems really fishy to me. However, I don't actually know. I mean I'm 21 and uneducated. I'm not a building designer or an engineer or some shit. I get into arguments with people often about this on both sides, and they both piss me off. I hate the conspiracy people who tell me that they know for sure what happened and if I question them that I am just an idiot who believes whatever I'm told by the mainstream media, and I also hate the people who immediately say ""you're crazy if you question the official story you stupid conspiracy theorist!"". To me its like two sides of the same coin, just people picking one side and not thinking critically about it. I can't tell you if WTC 7 was a controlled demolition or if there were explosives in the buildings or Larry Silverstein had anything to do with it. I have watched some youtube videos and news stories though, just like 99% of people who argue for or against the conspiracy. I just feel like people on BOTH sides of this issue should be a lot more open minded about it.  By the way I think the chemtrail theory is false and I have actually gotten into an argument with someone who thinks chemtrails are real and that 9/11 was not a conspiracy, and that I was stupid for questioning the 9/11 story. It blew my mind.   Anyway I just wanted to say please don't think all conspiracy people are insane, to me its just about being open minded. Questioning these things is healthy, being an asshole isn't. And to add another conspiracy to your list there is the disinformation conspiracy, that the CIA and the powers that be create a lot of the conspiracy theories that exist by spreading false info, which is thrown up on /r/conspiracy and other forums which then discredits those places of discussion, which I personally believe is fairly likely.

"""Liberia was established as a colony of the United States to dump freed black slaves into because white people didn't want free black people in the US.  Black people were strongly encouraged by white colonial societies to emigrate there where they eventually managed to gain a foothold, declare independence, and proceeded to brutally subjugate the locals for the next 150 years. All while propped up by the United States.  This segregationist society (Americans vs natives) persisted throughout most of the 20th century culminating in a coup and eventual civil war which lasted over a decade during which there was extensive child soldiering, slavery, rape and widespread pillaging and indiscriminate murder of civilians along other war crimes.   That's thankfully over now and Libera has emerged as only the fourth poorest country in the entire world.   So yes, blacks were emigrating there *during the slavery era over a hundred years ago*, because it was a white plan to get rid of them (the locals be damned). And what a great success it turned out. /s""",1

On top of that, for the first 6 years he started his business, he took 50% of his salary and invested heavily on Proctor &amp; Gamble, which is where the bulk of their wealth comes from now.  I was talking with him recently and he said he owns around 300,000 shares.  I picked up my smartphone to Google Finance ""PG"".  I guess he knew what I was doing, because he looked at me and said, ""Its around $24,000,000, Rath.""  The really fucking nutty part is that their dividend payouts have been around $0.64 a share, which means for the past few years he's been getting another $190,000~ every 3 months.  So honestly what's $30,000 to him?  Its like two weeks of dividend payouts.  I honestly don't know why he didn't just buy it outright for her, but I guess he wants to instill some level of responsibility into her, especially since he came up dirt poor.  I feel sorry for whoever marries her, but at least they'll be comforted by all the cash they'll inherit, since he has four children and they're all getting an equal split of the family assets.

That's the way that all pre-feminist societies have thrived since the dawn of time - it's  science. So what's holding you back from getting laid? Just go out there and take what you want - you don't ask a cow for it's consent to milk it, why would you ask a woman to consent to sex? By the way, we don't advocate rape, we're not misogynists, and we're really all about self-improvement. /S""",1

It's hard to say anything cuz I haven't seen your build yet, but I would assume it is a light weight build (cuz all of my hovers are heavy and I haven't seen much of this problem).  The problem is hover's force application is proportional to the weight, to prevent hovers from sending craft flying to the moon, so there are various problems when the mechanic glitches up on light hover. One of it is the inability to turn quickly because there is not enough force. Another is being randomly flinged to the sky. If you suffer from this symptoms, try adding weight to your bot...

I have 2 daughters, and I would not have any problem letting her teach them.  I am sure that she was not chatting porn to the kids.  They, evil fuckers that they are, went out and found it on their own and wrecked her life for fun.  Many years ago in my school, they fired a teacher because the cops raided an adult book store where folks were using a glory hole between two booths, and he was there at the book store during the raid.  We never knew if he was involved in the glory hole activities, but it didn't make any difference; the school district fired him immediately.  We kids raised hell on his behalf, signed petitions and stuff we thought might help, but it didn't help.  I don't know what's next.

"""Because we aren't responsible for the actions of our forebears?  We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man.   And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action, diversity quotas and scholarships that white people (even ones as poor or poorer) don't get. They don't want change.   The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution.   What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in (and as a measurable consequence, an increase in crime)?   The cause of their problems lie in two places:   The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime  And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them.   The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level.   How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies.   Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness, being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated, you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you.

"""When I was a youngster until I was I was in my teens, I had the same recurring figure. Not the same dream, always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night, culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night, I could see what looked like (to me) the poster from The Exorcist.  Now, the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping, and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way, lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom &amp; Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dance/lumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet, nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway, into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot, something nearby or by just biting down.  Over the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs, big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue (looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish), horrifying.  The last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting...  The dream started the same way it always did. The impending music, Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac, but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there, waiting, watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke, in my Dad's voice... ""Well done. I'm proud of you."" Then he walked away.  I've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that.""",0

Maybe this is semantics, but I think such a strong distinction is unnecessary. GR subsumes and includes everything SR contains and makes no distinction where a connection comes from, the formalism is identical. Curvature is curvature in the math even if it is sourced by proper acceleration. The concept of *generalized* relativity which includes all aspects of relativity is a perspective I've heard from other physicists many times.  For example, a frame with constant acceleration the curvature induces a nonzero vacuum expectation value and you get thermal radiation. All of this occurs on what is otherwise a true flat background and is intimately related to Hawking Radiation.""",0

I think it's too early to tell if the glitches are Pioneer/Alpine issues or if it's on Apple's end. I have little respect for the software development skills of either Pioneer or Alpine, so I'm inclined to point the finger at them. Once OEMs start installing Carplay we should have a better idea.   Speaking of OEMs, once we see Carplay in factory systems I think Carplay will start to offer more apps and features. I don't know how Carplay apps are added to existing apps or are vetted by the App store, but they're being added at a snail's pace. Based on the lack of Carplay units on the road, it's hard to blame app developers for not making their apps Carplay compatible.

"""Hello guys, I would like to establish the Kingdom of Sarnor on the rp at some point (whenever I get a free character slot), but it was recently on my mind and I thought it might be good to iron out some details before that happens. So, time for the history mumbo jumbo.  We assume that the Doom of Valyria occurred around 105 BC and directly after that commenced the Century of Blood that swept through Essos. During this time, the Kingdom of Sarnor was decimated by the Dothraki, almost completely slaughtered after the Field of Crows. The Tall Men were driven back to Saath and numbered only about 20,000 after all was said and done and the Century of Blood was over. We'll say it's been about 500 or so years since this point to where the rp is now. My point is to figure out a rough estimate of the current population of Sarnor (other Dothraki raids notwithstanding and can be calculated into the total when all is sorted).   I've done three calculation for you mods to decide between.  * 5% Birth rate (A generous number and the least likely of the three, but I figured I'd throw it in) would leave the current population at 500,000 in the year 505AC * 3% Birth rate (Average, more akin to the birthrate seen in the world today) would leave the current population at 300,000 in the year 505AC * 1% Birth rate (A somewhat low number, but could be completely understandable if factoring other wars and raids into the figure) would leave the current population at 100,000 in the year 505AC  Thank you for reading this little bit! As I said before, these populations do not take into account various other raids or catastrophes that might have happened. Also, I understand this sub is about storytelling and not about hard numbers and the like, but I feel having a mod approved rough estimate of the population would only be a good thing for world building in a civilization that was once destroyed.

"""On a good day? Every few hours. On a bad day, pretty much non-stop to varying degrees.  It's a complex beast.

But at the end of the day, I chose this and I'm fucking going to make it work.  I've had to experiment with various responses and strategies. I tried to dial back my emotions and care level but it was erratic at best, and constantly fighting myself like that was exhausting.  I've tried opening up and being completely honest and communicative of my feelings and that was even worse, because there's way more stupid whiny petty hurtful shit in my head than anyone else should have to deal with, and I wound up regretting a lot of things I said and instantly wished I could take back. That's just not the version of me I want to present to my partner, or to the world in general.  At the moment I'm hovering around a slightly modified, hopefully more sustainable version of what you've described. I don't *deny* my emotional responses, but I do try to filter them, and force myself to take time to think my way through stuff before I say or do something I regret. Sometimes that means delayed responses or removing myself from situations if I'm not sure how I feel about them, and I don't always get it right, but I think it's helping. I'm working to keep pushing my boundaries and comfort zone, albeit gently, and to stay as outgoingly positive as I can without being insincere.

"""&gt; People ought to be able to bitch and moan as much as they want.  If this is a 'Freedom of Speech' principle, I'm going to throw out a simple point.  People ought to be *able* but they should not ought to be *inclined.*   'Bitching and moaning'? I think we can both tell from your simple use of terminology that it's just negativity. If it was people throwing compliments in earnest, randomly, I would consider the matter differently. But I do not see much reason in 'bitching and moaning' without seeking a *real* solution.  Bearing in mind I had only read those words as I've typed this. I'm not assuming anything of you.  &gt; The ought to be able to do that without people jumping down their throats calling them 'self entitled assholes'.  I didn't call them assholes. I'm quite careful with things like that.  I'd argued that it's self-entitled and currently I stand by it. I have provided reasons as to why I find that as the case.  &gt; It looks free because you don't pay anything to play it. But if people don't buy skins, if people don't buy champs, if people don't buy stuff, then the game can't exist.  For the record, I've spent a decent sum of money on the game. That shouldn't be relevant, but in the case that you were using a logical fallacy (argumentum ad hominem - ""argument against the man"") I'd like to refute it. In the case that you're making the point that it is not free, then I'd like to specify that ""Free-to-play"" refers to those who choose to play it that way.  You are right in saying that without payments, the game could not exist. Could Riot Games even exist if that were the case? Maybe, I don't know. But it is free to many people, and any new player who chooses to play now also has the choice to pay; they are not mutually inclusive options.  Same for any one player who does it now. The only time this changes is if we consider all or most players making this decision.  &gt; As such, we're entitled to say what we like about what Riot adds to the game.  You purchased what you purchased; your skins, your champions, your Rune Pages.  You do not gain entitlement through spending money. You do not gain possession of the game through spending money. You do not gain a louder voice by spending money.  Why would you? It is very ignorant to assume that Riot's on *your* or any other individual's payroll. That's why voting with your wallet is sound reasoning. Does it always get heard, though?  Of course not, because there are -- particularly in League of Legends' case, *millions* of other players making the same considerations but making different choices to you.  If you stopped paying right now, maybe they'll notice a digit or two go down. Do you think that if we both stopped paying right now, it would change their minds at all?  If I had spent £0 on this game, I would consider myself as entitled to talk about the game as I am now. The principle is that it is people's *choice* as to what they do with their money, and if they do not choose to purchase skins/chromas/Riot Points, then that is perfectly acceptable.  So, my overall point is that you *are* entitled to say what you'd like. But not only is that *not* sufficient reason to say what you'd like, but it is *not* because you 'bought' that right.  &gt; It's not being an asshole to say your mind.  Never said it was.  &gt; It's not being a douchebag to complain.  It could just be ignorance, or stupidity, or a temper, or a bad day. Could be plenty of things.  But if you think about it logically and you have a moment of self-awareness, you're not going to 'bitch' unless you thought it would change something. People 'bitch' everyday. To people they know can't resolve the situation.  Going to Reddit? Sure, that could make an impact; people do take in views from here from time to time.  But if someone is going to identify an opposing view as ""ridiculous"", then I'm inclined to identify such perspective as ignorant, in this case.  &gt; It's our right as the people who make the game what it is.  You have way too much ""consumer empowerment"" going through you right now.  &gt; And if Riot comes out with a product that I think is fucking stupid and overpriced, I'm gonna say ""Riot, that shit is stupid and overpriced. Heroes of the Storm has it for free. Make it the way I want it."".  In other words, you're self-entitled.  Which is fine. But I'd rather go about it some way like this.  ""Riot, X as a concept has a lot of potential to work, and I honestly think you can pull it off quite well. But I don't think that it's cost-efficient for many people who play League to actually buy this.   It offers Y, Z, Alpha and Beta, which is great, but there's quite a lot of room for improvement in either cost or features and I think that without it, I'm not going to find it an appropriate expense and I think that that'll be the case for a lot of potential customers, too. I mean, look at your skins and chroma packs; they do pretty well at these prices. I don't know how much work it takes for you to make X and if it *needs* to be that high, but if it can drop down in price, it'd be a much more appealing offer.""  Also, you're talking about another game whose skins can cost £10.00 by themselves the *majority* of the time. Only Ultimate skins are like that in League.   If you want to keep trying to quantify between Blizzard and Riot Games, then might I point out the Pay-to-Play *business model* that World of Warcraft has?  *And* it has micro transactions?  Blizzard / Riot Games are apples and oranges, just like MMORPGs and MOBAs or a MOBA and another MOBA. Don't try to draw comparisons, because it's not going to stand very well.""",0

Only a dozen or so of Rise's navigation lines are triggered during specific boss fights, and you're most likely leveled too high to pick up all navigation lines you missed. Here's some tips on how I got it:  * Play on Hard or higher difficulty. If you're over-leveled, you'll miss many of her lines.  * You will have to use all of the characters, there's no way around it. In your next playthrough, get to the top of each dungeon, exit, switch out all your characters, and start again from the bottom. Look for enemies that cause status ailments, and keep fighting them with every character until you've heard all the lines associated with that ailment.  * Don't guard or heal characters. Let them get knocked down and affected with status ailments. Each effect on each character has two or three lines associated with getting inflicted with each ailment.  * Don't level up your party's S. Links. Doing so will let characters help each other recover from effects. Rise has dozens of lines for characters recovering from ailments on their own.  * Do level up Rise's S. Link as fast as you can. The lines she says about enemies' weakness at the beginning of each battle count. She also has many lines for when she helps you in battle, including taking damage for you and recovering knocked out characters.  * You can try scanning every enemy you fight, but there's no clear consensus whether those lines count or not. I did it anyway.  I got the trophy in the Hollow Forest on my first playthrough, but I was actively trying to get it to pop. Some people get lucky and get it without trying, but I've heard of others doing three or more playthroughs and never getting it. Do everything you can to trigger lines, and you shouldn't have a problem.""",0

"""In 5th edition, your skills (perception, deception, investigation, etc) don't use a point system to increase. The bonuses to each skill is determined by two things: your ability score (strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, wisdom, charisma) and your proficiency bonus.  Your proficiency bonus scales up as you level, and what skills it's applied to depends on your class and I think your background.  Your ability scores are generated when you make your character, and can be done by what's called the point-buy system that is outlined in the player's handbook, but a quick google search should tell you how it works, as lots of systems, such as pathfinder, and even older versions of D&amp;D use it. Alternatively you can do it old school, and take 4 six sided die, roll them all, drop the lowest die, and add the rest together  The ""bonus"" from the ability is usually the only number you care about, not the actual score itself, and is determined by taking the score, dividing by two and subtracting 5. So a score of 12, is a bonus of +1, but a score of 8 is a bonus of -1 (note, always round down for this, so a score of 11 is a bonus of 0)  Now for each skill you take the appropriate ability score bonus associated with it (ex wisdom for perception) and the proficiency bonus if applicable and boom, you have your total skill bonus""",0

Here are some tips that are mainly for new players but should be helpful to returning players as well.  http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/3485dw/general_advice_for_a_noob/cqs849b  &gt; its nice to see new nexians, so for you the same advice as al, cause these are kind of FAQ for new players:  &gt; 1 go to pve server entity on NA or jabbit on EU (the pvp servers lack population, you will find more fun with us on pve)  &gt; 2 activate hold to cast in your combat menu, press escape&gt;combat&gt;input options&gt; hold to cast  &gt; 3 join the global channels, if you are on entity :  &gt;    exile side: /chjoin lfg &gt;    dom side: /chjoin entitylfm  &gt; to talk write /1, ask anything there the community is very welcoming  &gt; 4 people tend not to use the looking for group tool, they tend to do premades so you will get faster queues if you make a group the old way, spamming in zone chat and global channels  &gt; 5 when questing the xp given are tied to the class of the quest, there are 5 classes  &gt; world story: gives the most exp, a must do quest Regional story: gives less than world story, do this ones too Zone story: gives a good chunk of exp but less than regional  &gt; task: gives the minimal xp, dont overstay in a place doing them, just do the other 3 classes of quest and move to other hubs  &gt; path quest: these dont give exp to level but to increase your path, you can come do this ones when you are level capped or do it for the sweet perks of your path for leveling (btw if you are maxed in your path these kind of quest will give xp instead)  &gt; 6 Moments of opportunity are the best dps enhancer in the game, to make one interrupt a mob when he is casting something, his hp bar will turn purple abd you will do 150% of damage (for interrupt, stun him or use abilities that say ""remove x interrupt armor""  &gt; 7 there is a lot of exp enhancers to make leveling fast and smooth (but the adventure is in the journey not the destination so if you want to feel the world and not rush it just dont use them)  &gt;    8% xp buff from guild     8% xp from flask (you can buy it with renown if your guild has unlocked this perk)     2% from authenticator     5-10% from house (at lvl 15 you will get your own house, visit it once a day to get a buff for leveling, it can be 5% or 10% depending on the day)     when log off leave your char into your plot, it will get rested xp (you can get more rested xp if you decorate your plot or even leave it in a fried plot who has the max decor buff)  &gt; 8 dodge a lot  &gt; 9 almost all in the UI is customizable, so you can move it to where you feel more comfortable, some people use forge UI as an addon for this, but there are addons out there for specific clases, cause well your interface changes a little between classes)  &gt; 10 there are a tons of usefull addons, i just use strikehardmeter for dps, latency meter for get a visual of the ping and LFG Board for getting groups (like the premade group finder on wow).  &gt; 11 when creating a char you can skip the first 3 levels by marking skip arkship, but if you are new i recommend not to skip it cause it will teach you some usefull things  &gt; 12 join a guild, this game its better with friends to play it and guilds give good perks  &gt; i think that cover the basic, good luck on nexus   Edit: I think I should mention that drop 5 [(Invasion:Nexus)](http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-03-12-wildstars-next-big-update-invasion-nexus/) is coming within the next two months.

"""Seconded on the natural food sources.  I've had good luck with apple trees (craft an apple) combined with fern seeds from the fossils mod (they only grow under trees, but grow fast).  I did also make the trees artificially taller by planting them a few blocks up, and then filling in underneath with logs (I thinks it's prettier).  For my carnivores, I have pigs in with them.  Duncan could set up a little pig farm next to each pen with a chronotyper embedded in the wall to sort pigs into the enclosure.  Or just move some in with a lasso.  And of course, all of this would have been a lot easier if Duncan actually knew how to hand feed them!  Right click with an appropriate food, and it feeds and heals them (no need for potions).  He can use the Dinopedia to check what they eat.  Admittedly, I've had trouble doing this with full grown T-rexes, maybe because of their size.  But I've had no luck with feeders or tossing food on the ground.  Best of luck!""",0

It's just my experience, but after watching companies run from the inside, I can say I wouldn't be shocked *in the slightest* that Marvel and Disney and DC and WB have no relevant research in this area. Quite a lot of the time, the decision makers go with ""common knowledge"" and ""their gut"" and don't even think of it in that manner. Hell, even if they did look for that kind of research, it's very likely they don't have it just based on the fact that they have always paid so much attention to marketing this stuff to boys.   (For example, the medical field, and thus for things like dosage instructions on the back of medicine, for pretty much its entire existence ran on studies that were primarily made up of white men. It was only fairly recently that doctors - at least in the US - looked at things like diet recommendations and dosages and said ""hold up, why are we giving everyone the same instructions when there are very real differences to take into account here?"" That sort of thing happening in marketing as well isn't exactly farfetched.)

First of all, the n in this case is (0,0,1), so we're left with just the z-part of the vector. Second, the area of a disk is easy to calculate, so the final calculation is made a lot easier as well.  To give some physical explanation for why this is allowed. We're calculating the flux through this surface. Look at the object created by also adding the disk. Every fieldline that goes into the object, also has to come out, and since the field is pointed upwards, every line that exits through the spheresection has to enter through the disk, so the flux through the disk and the flux through the spheresection are the same.""",0

Mild cheddar to me is like eating chocolate cake with the flavour magically removed. Why bother?  I found the paneer similarly bland. It was perfectly edible, but didn't make me desire to eat it. The seasonings applied were tasty, but could have been better applied to chicken, where they blended and complemented the flavour.   I guess it was somewhat like eating cardboard tikka. good seasoning, but the heart of it wasn't something I desire to eat.    I don't eat tofu for a couple reasons, but since it's a similar soft, mostly-flavourless blob that you just apply flavouring to, I imagine I would find it similarly undesirable.  (I eat meat, so I have no reason to turn to tofu, and I figure there are enough soy byproducts in so many other things these days that I'd just as well stay away from eating big chunks of soy. the only tofu I eat is in shelf-stable TVP ground form when backpacking, where it offers significant advantages over meat.)

Turning on in pit bulls is becoming dog aggressive.   My little bitch was at the dog park for 2-3 fucking hours, every single day, without fail from the day after her shots were done to about 9 months old. I took her to classes, I took her to stores, I took her everywhere. Didn't matter, little hot girl turned on at 9ish months and we had to stop dog park. She still has dog friends, but they're from her puppy stage and have established relationships. She gets on good with plenty of new dogs, but the 2% she wants to attack plus the 100% that she would never back down from and welcome a fight from meant no more dog park for the most part.   You need to make sure that these boys are extremely clear on the fact that she's got extremely strong prey drive and also dog aggression. They need to verbally confirm that they understand that they cannot own another dog or pet while he's still alive with them.   I think the fact you could go visit and also babysit is pretty cool. It's a unique opportunity that lessens the hurt of this decision.   Lastly, I hate to judge you on appearances, but you seem like the kind of girl who's priorities in life are your social and night life.

"""Lol.  That's my comment you're talking about.  I'm a public defender.  Exposing lying cops is one of the favorite parts of my job.  Telling people they're probably shit out of luck is a pretty common response in the sub, but that's largely because there are a lot of posts that warrant that response.  I employ a similar approach with my clients:  I don't sugarcoat anything, and I focus on what we *can* do.  Sometimes this is quite a bit, other times it's not much.    I do agree with you though that snark, derision, and telling people they're wrong, happen more than necessary. Lurkers seem to upvote based on entertainment value, so judgmental replies can sometimes rise to the top.  I can definitely be guilty of some snark, but I always attempt to include helpful questions or comments alongside.  And sometimes you have to dig a bit deeper or wait around for something genuinely helpful.  [Here's a good recent example](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/33oc2p/trespassing_charges_from_an_officer_for_crossing) where the top-rated comment tells the guy he's guilty, and then the guy comes along later on to say that he successfully fought the ticket.

The tournament I joined and am fluctuating between the low to mid 30s for ranking which is higher than I expected, so will be playing more of that. I lost about 20K in gold since I didn't see it cost money per search but it's so easy to come by I'm not worried.  That makes sense with Dr. Donut. There have been times I needed a certain field creature but they were either in the discard or deep in the deck. I'll start leveling him now. Then hopefully obtain Hunson at some point.

The data might still be there but it is unretrievable and has no purpose. In such a world there is no true love or kindness, evil or hate, there are just chemicals and hormones incentivizing and compelling us to act in certain ways. Some people believe this is the truth because they think science is rational, and there is no objective proof that there is something else.  My personal opinion is the double-slit experiment proves that science as understood by humans is still mysterious, subjective, and incomplete. The study of art and humanities (and psychedelics) have probed human experience and come up with explanations far more beautiful and terrible than what science alone can offer. What's the harm in believing in that we could be experiencing something much more magical than we know?  As a species, we should encourage the marriage of science and art instead of creating a false division between the two. We must explore our spiritual capacities, in addition to the scientific laws that bind our universe. Both can be true simultaneously.   At the end of the day, believe in what brings you peace.""",0

I feel as though it helped me find characters I liked much faster including ones I never thought I'd like. Being forced to try everyone really opens your eyes to the fact that a crazy amount of characters are viable in this game and a fresh meta.   Honestly many of the fundamentals translate. Bairs are strong on almost everyone and pivoting into them really increases success. Paper scissors rock is definitely a major aspect.

There are 5814 offenders  52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number  24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole number   There are 245,532,000 whites in America  There are 41,600,000 blacks in America   We can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get:  1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 2013  1 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013   This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites, per capita.

"""Necromancy is one of those things that's been codified as 'evil' because that's just the typical fantasy archetype for it, but not without good reason. As the classic alignments go, 'Evil' is considered selfish, disrespectful, and dishonorable, and necromantic magic falls into a lot of those categories. Some of the chief reasons include the following:  * General respect for the bodies of the dead. Most societies value the symbolic gesture of putting their dead to rest (which is why a lot of the time when a person dies in war or execution in other countries, they go to great lengths to get the bodies sent back home), so even if the corpse is mindless, their relatives and friends wouldn't take kindly to it. * It's considered a cheap and horrible form of psychological warfare. Imagine you're fighting a war, one of your close comrades-in-arms dies, and next thing you know they're raised as a shambling corpse trying to kill you. It might be effective but generally it'd be considered a pretty abhorrent thing to do to someone, both the person who died and their loved ones. * Depending on the game and the setting, necromantic magic (and other similar kinds of dark magics) are innately corrupting, degrading either the caster's soul or body. * On that note (and I think this is the big one), I believe under the standard PF setting, raising a corpse with necromancy anchors the soul to that body, trapping them in their shambling corpse until the undead body is slain (that's why in the Golarian setting, Pharasma, the goddess of death, abhors necromancy; because it's a perversion of the cycle and keeps souls from her realm). So the whole 'putting their soul to rest' shtick is quite literally freeing their soul from their body so they can peacefully go to the afterlife.  Obviously all this depends on the setting. It's generally codified that necromancy follows a lot of these conventions, but depending on the setting it may be considered socially acceptable, and the rules about corruption and soul-anchoring may not exist, so it's less abhorrent for the person who's body it was.  If the setting your playing in has all those conventions, however, there's not much you'll be able to do to convince other people what your doing isn't somewhat abhorrent. The act of raising dead bodies isn't going to be something you can really make anyone feel comfortable about, and all other kinds of necromantic magic is inherently about torture and suffering, so again that's not going to win you any friends.  From a player perspective, what you want to do is accept that's the case and run with it. Maybe your character is trying to prove a point that not all necromancers are evil while being ignorant to the social and technical pitfalls with it? Maybe he's just genuinely ignorant and doesn't understand why everyone looks down on him for it? Think about those things with the above info in mind.""",0

So long as we can agree that the Bechdel test isn't a test which demonstrates whether a movie should or should not be made, but which can be used to examine movies made in a year in aggregate- it seems like a useful tool to me.  Back when we were doing the advocacy exchange project, we had a subject on the portrayal of women in popular media, and the bechdel test [featured heavily in what I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/1y3pvf/taep_mra_discussion_portrayal_of_women_in_popular/cfh4984).  I guess the TLDR is: my only criticisms of the bechdel test would be if it is proposed as an absolute metric for the worth of a movie, or presented as an infallible way to identify whether a movie depicted strong women, or if it was presented as the only way to determine if a movie treated gender fairly.

"""Its simply a test range nowhere in the film does it say that its some kind of gamma bomb test range. It could be radiation. The CLOUD DID NOTHING TO BRUCE PHYSICALLY it is a mental imprint of a horrible incident on him. The only exposure he had when he was a kid was the one he was born with. The mushroom cloud is simply an incident wherein everyone was evacuated and only the base was destroyed. The reason Bruce was able to withstand the Gamma Ray burst which would have killed anyone else was because of the regenerative trait he was born with that was passed on by his father.   I think you have real issues understanding non-standard narrative devices. No one was exposed to anything in that blast other than possible radioactive drift, unless they made it out of the exclusion zone. Or it wasn't even radioactive. Mushroom clouds can be caused by all kinds of explosions.   He needed to cure his son because he never intended for his son to be a part of the experiment and he had no idea what it would do to Bruce. In the end the passed down trait saved Bruce from a Gamma Ray burst that would have surely killed him. I have no problem with them figuring out a way to make it marginally more believable why Bruce would survive that Gamma Ray burst as it would melt any person exposed to it. In fact even his friend shouldn't have survived.   You are wrong many people like the Hulk especially film enthusiasts.

"""I have very vivid dreams every night, here are the two most common.  - I walk down the stairs into a dark basement. There is always a door at the bottom. It slowly creeks open and a giant hissing crocodile emerges. I try to scramble up the stairs and keep tripping and falling the whole way up. I finally get to the top and collapse and my legs wont work. I try to scream for help but nothing comes out, all while this croc slowly gets closer and closer. Eventually it gets to me and eats me.  - This one the context of the dream is always different except for 1 detail it always takes place in the mountains. I could be riding a bike, in the city in the middle of a car chase, or in a park with some girl I wanna bang. Then out of nowhere a giant meteorite impacts the side of a mountain nearby and huge chunk of the mountain gets blown off and flies towards me. It is always so vivid and real. So this chunk is massive and I know there is nothing I can do but just watch it fly towards me. Right before it impacts I wake up.  I forgot about a sleep paralysis dream I get. Not as common as the other 2, I get it maybe 3 times a year. I will be lying in bed and then I wake up (at least I think I do) but I cant move a single muscle. The only thing that functions is my eyes. Then a black cat with glowing eyes will jump up onto the foot of the bed start hissing at and screeching at me while it slowly crawls up my body towards my face. I will try and kick and scream but nothing works. Its much like the Crocodile dream except I can see and sense everything going on around me. my girlfriend has even been watching TV beside me while it happens and looked at me and asked ""whats wrong with me?"" while I stare into space not blinking or moving. And I can see her and hear her but cant respond. eventually the cat gets to my stomach, crouches low lets out a hiss and pounces at my throat. As its mid leap it just turns to smoke and disappears. The second it disappears I can move and scream, and I do every time.... The weird part is everything stays the same its like the only thing that was dream was the cat that was put into the real world that I see in front of me. """,0

Usually it is not the distance that is the problem, but the angle, and when it is the distance it is usually by only a step or two.

Suddenly, a HUGE ball of light with a white hot center and green rim shot across the sky, starting from the top-right corner of our vision and passed over the mountain in front of us within a second, *maybe* a second and a half. The weird thing was that it lit up the top part of the mountain it was passing over... like, a lot of it. It was real bright.  We all just sorta sat there for a second until someone piped up... uh, did anyone else see that? Agreed on color, shape, momentum. Our skeptic said it had to be a missile test from the nearby military spot but that thing was flying relatively low to the ground which is super dangerous, the base is 30 miles away, and that thing was moving CRAZY QUICK.

You have a stack of 50(say 2 gold each for a total of 100g) of an item, versus a stack of 200(1g each for a total of 200g) of an item. The latter is cheaper per unit, but you only need 50...So while I am paying a little more for less, I am overall paying less gold for what I need.  Same applies here.

"""Because much of the Torah needs explanation. It's like trying to build a car without the instructions. Sure, you can put pieces of it together on your own, but eventually, you'll need explanations.   This is what Aish.com has to say on the matter:  &gt;The story is told about a fellow who applies for a job at a prestigious investment banking firm. The interviewer looks at his resume and says, ""I see you went to Harvard Business School. Very nice. Tell me, what year did you graduate?"" The fellow says, ""1990."" ""1990. Did you ever take any courses with Professor Stevens?"" ""Stevens? No."" ""Okay, how about Professor Phillips? He's one of the most popular professors at Harvard. Older fellow, grey hair. Did you meet him?"" ""Nope, never heard of Phillips."" ""You went to the Harvard Business School and you don't know two of the most popular professors?! I don't get it. Did you attend Harvard or not?"" ""Well, I guess I should be honest with you. I didn't actually go to Harvard. My roommate attended the Harvard Business School. He used to bring home all his notes and textbooks, and I read everything he brought home. So when he graduated, I figured I graduated, too."" The interviewer was not impressed. And our ""graduate"" didn't get the job. (Or if he did, it's one of those firms that's out of business now...) Why isn't it enough just to read the notes to be considered a Harvard graduate? Because you need to hear the lectures. The professors add so much information that the notes simply don't present a full view of the subject. If you want to get a full understanding of a text, what's the best way to find out? Ask the experts: ""What's behind this? Please explain it."" Information in the written form is, by definition, secondary and limited in scope. That's why the Oral Torah is 50 times the size of the Written Torah! (In actuality, the Oral Torah is infinite. It contains the totality of Torah, which – as the word of the infinite G-d – is by its very definition infinite.)""",0

That didn't change that fact that outside influences had an effect on my feelings, but to really realize that was pretty important I think.  Even when others judge you, it's your feelings that make you feel what you feel.   Also, that feeling you described about feeling ""bad"", and ""Not worthy"", those are bang on.   Because I've realized that I feel very uncomfortable around innocence.   Around babies/children, dogs, really kind people, family....etc.  I am naturally attracted to dark things, those things interest me more than positive light things, and that's supposed to be bad and negative.    My idea of heaven is not white and bright things and perfectly clean clothing, it's carnivals and fun houses, and fast cars and tunnels that lead to alternate dimensions and entertainment (basically Earth minus the shit I don't like)....etc.   I've always wondered if that is spiritual, or psychological, or if they are one and the same.  I've heard it's kind of common to be afraid of children, but I think it's weird.   I guess i'm into some stuff that most would consider kind of shameful, and I know that if they knew they'd feel differently about me.  Only my closest friend knows about one of them, and I am very fortunate that he is alright knowing it.

"""It's not too confusing if you are cynical enough to believe people will be duplicitous and manipulative if given the chance.  The writer ""Zak"" bugged Eron to do an interview for an extended period. Eron is smart but incredibly naive - I assume this Zak guy assured him he'd write a fair article. Instead, he likely intended to trash him all along, while assuring LW he'd make her look good.  It was interesting that the Zak guy seemed to create a new twitter account to ask Eron for the interview. I googled it the other day and it seemed there was only one tweet (this is a separate account from his real twitter account).  Another interesting point in Eron's tumblr response was that he logged into his Facebook account on Zak's laptop to show him the chat logs with LW. So there's no excuse for Zak having overlooked the abuse and deceit Eron was subjected to.  This all tells me Zak is an SJW, an activist writer who intended all along to smear Eron. It's beyond my comprehension why Eron would agree to an interview after the three or four hit pieces SJW journalists did on him last Fall.""",0

In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort.

"""That's an interesting Theory. Since I'm an engineer and not a theoretical particle physicist, I enjoy working with tangible objects instead of weird little matter bugs. So that kind of theoretical drive is too beyond my understanding to offer a comment to the affirmative or negative. However, it sounds plausible. If a particle was spun (enough to provide a measurable, useful change in space-time) and shot by a compact particle accelerator (or it could drift into it, who am I to judge a lazy particle?) into an energy uptake system on the other side, I can see that working. This field change would need to be modulated to provide more efficient  ""forward"" travel through space-time. Modulated or given an ""anti-spin"" (as I see it it my head) to cause a (to me) a necessary opposite shift in space time at the other end. Where a higher point mass might cause a contraction of space time on one end, and a higher ""anti""mass would cause an expansion. My use of anti doesn't mean I'm necessarily suggesting spinning an anti particle, because I don't know much about antimatter and the like and their properties. I just mean ""do the opposite on the other end"".  It's might be possible that doing the same thing to something else might produce expansion. It's also possible that a different method is the only way of doing that and the uptake system could power that too. Who knows.   But yeah I really like your input. I might contact you about your opinions while I do these articles. I'd also like to get drunk and have a conversation about this stuff with you. I believe that would be a good time. My brain hurts less when I think about things like this from a very specific view point for too long.

Rice and alfalfa (which can be grown in a ton of places, and are very water intensive) are the low hanging fruit for what farmers may stop producing.  Second, the commodity price of vegetables is a pretty small chunk of overall food costs.  Much more of the food budget of Americans goes into meat, packaging, transportation, and marketing than does commodity vegetables.  Third, there are substitution effects.  California produces a lot of vegetables, but lots of vegetables get grown in other places too.  For instance, green beans are primarily produced in slightly colder climates.

"""Except that this assumes our goals are opposite and our voices equal.  The tension you describe requires us to be in constant balance of forces.  If one group or voice becomes the stronger, and using that strength reinforces itself, then it becomes impossible for the tension to be maintained.  That view has a certain appeal, the ideal of symmetry is elegant and if achieved, powerful.  But it is also fragile.  At present it is best to imagine that the rope in the middle, that which we pull back and forth in our tug of war, has begun to fray.  As that takes place we separate, and worse yet, we stagnate.  Should that rope that binds us together snap entirely, we end up at war within our own nation, the very end that democracy seeks to avoid.  Whether through violent civil revolt, or the militarization of domestic police forces, the peace we sought to maintain is broken.  That's why it's impossible to get anything done.  That centre place of compromise grows thin and weak, it won't support the kind of work that needs to be done.  It also makes us vulnerable to outside changes.  The tension between workers and employers for example is a careful balance.  Introducing the concept of climate change, and the necessity of action on that front adds another rope to the pull on neither of those sides.  Workers fear for their livelihoods, and employers fear for their profits, so both pull against the greater good, attempting to strain enough to move the mountain that is reality.  In essence, this only works for the most limited of scenarios.  Perhaps it might work to encourage the poorest to pull against the richest.  But there is no centre point or common ground where reality is concerned.  It is what it is, and no amount of politics or voting or compromise will change that.  So at times reality will loom on that fringe, and we must all decide to abandon our previous arguments and tensions and move to safe ground.  If not, the floods will raise the water over our heads, and our tug of war will see only floating corpses still clinging to a now slack rope.  We have to be willing and able to vote according to our good conscience, our true wisdom and our intellects, not only according to our momentary benefit. """,0

It basically eliminates any performance penalty from running 2 processing threads on 1 available core because of this, but those two threads still only get 1/2 of the CPU's attention each.  4 physical cores will double your performance (100% improvement) if all of them are busy. Hyperthreading increases performance from 0% to 30% depending on what you are doing.  That's not bad at all, and when you have only 2 cores you are quite likely to multitask and take advantage of Hyperthreading compared to the same tasks on a hyperthreaded 4 core CPU.

"""DPS means nothing in Planetside 2 unless you could guarantee that every single shot hits the target. Thus, we use TTK, and that doesn't factor in 99% of the time when flying either.  The reason Tomcats are hated is the fact that 'they take no skill to use', which, while being rather generic, is also correct. Keeping a lock while under fire causes you to die quicker, as you just have to keep it in the general area, rather than matching the manoeuvres performed by the enemy, which has the side effect of dodging enemy fire.  If you want to use a secondary other than afterburner tanks, go with the Coyotes. While they do little damage, they damage the enemy while your primary is reloading, enabling you to keep up the damage as much as possible. People will respect you far more, and will be willing to teach you and fly with you if you use Coyotes rather than Tomcats.  As for dying a lot, I really hate saying this, but get used to it. It's only been recently I've been able to begin taking on enemy aircraft in a 1v1 and win, but against any pilot who has been flying longer than me, they will easily kill me (hence why I run stealth for ambushes and getaways). It's just the way it is. 'Softening' the blow of death through Tomcats really doesn't help much, because once you get good with the nosegun/Coyotes, it's scary what you can do. But with the Tomcats your flight style never changes, you never learn anything because you're always flying the exact same way: to keep the lock.   If you want to become better whatsoever, ditch the Tomcats. It's nothing but a crutch.""",0

Human vaccines are given into a muscle as we tend to have large muscle bellies than a cat.  Prep for subcutaneous shots are also very different.  Try to tent my skin and I will punch you.  Don't tent a cats skin and you will either hit a muscle, a blood vessel or a nerve. Two of which can result in you getting bit if the person restraining isn't ready for it.

Luckily there are better environmental protections in place, but many countries where exotic woods grow also unfortunately suffer from lots of government corruption; it's *very* easy for unscrupulous wood vendors to grease the palms of the politicians and policy makers in a lot of those countries, which has historically been an issue with woods like ebony. Not only do *we* have to want sustainably harvested lumber, but we have to convince those other countries that it's in their best interest to responsibly harvest their own lumber. Because many of those countries have a high rate of poverty, they're more inclined to take bribes and look the other way, in many cases simply because they're just trying to survive.

He walked up to me as I was laying in bed again. He bent over me and asked my how I was. I said that I was fine and he left. It has taken me a very long time to understand how I felt about this. Turns out I was angry at myself for failing something that I set out to do. I felt like garbage for so long. It took me 5 years to admit to myself that my self directed anger and loathing ment nothing. The past is the past. There is nothing that can be done about it. But my future, my happiness needs not be influenced by past failures. I was angry at myself, and I finally learned why. And I finally forgave myself.""",0

Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now?  As for ""Hate the sin. Love the sinner"", it's like saying ""I still love you, but I hate a thing that you do that is (likely) closely tied with a major part of your identity.""

We want to have Android and iOS as the standard platforms for accessing and controlling house stuff. Kodi apps (Kore, Yatse, etc) for the media, OpenHAB for automation. Since every project (and its users) is different in significant ways, flexibility in the UI design turns out to be quite important.  With Domoticz and I was initially excited by the potential of the Lua scripting but OpenHAB has so many appealing bindings (plugins) available - bluetooth, networkhealth, TV interfaces, XBMC/Kodi...  Integrating with network monitoring apps like Cacti is important to me. OpenHAB will write its persistence data to RRDs if you want and I expect those will be pretty easy to make visible to Cacti. I have no idea how I'd get the graph data out of Domoticz short of scraping the database or manually exporting the graphs (in CSV?).  I'm still coming to terms with OpenHAB's use of Java and Xtend. The last time I did any serious work in Java was in 2002. It's matured quite a bit since (lambda syntax, whee!), so the learning curve for serious scripting is still steep.  There are a couple of tricks I've learned so far for OpenHAB UI configuration:  * Don't use Groups in the Sitemap (except as summary values). It's really tempting but just don't. Explicit is better.  * Don't bother with the Setpoint elements. They're currently very slow and user-unfriendly. Using a Selection with a mapping argument listing every possible value is actually so much more user-friendly.  [EDIT: grammar a bit]""",0

There's no real chance Dubnyk leaves Minnesota for San Jose, so the only free agent they could go after that would make sense would be Niece himself, but I'd imagine there might be some difficulty since they don't seem confident enough in Nemo to give him a long term deal and a bridge deal may not be enough to keep him. Perhaps they sign and trade, or look for another option via trade. Bernier or Reimer could be available. There's a chance either Hammond or Anderson leave Ottawa, depending on how the situation develops with them and Lehner. Buffalo trades goalies all the time; maybe Lindback makes a comeback and they flip him for the rebuild. That's a bit of a long shot, but he showed promise at the end of the season with them. Maybe Vancouver moves Markstrom if he continues his rebound. Maybe with Gillies joining the Flames they look to move Ramo. There's even a chance they could go after prospects like Kristers Gudlevskis, Zachary Fucale or Malcolm Subban. I'm just saying they have options, but they will likely have to give up something to get a goalie here if theyre not drafting one. """,0

There was one similar post a few months back with just this scenario. Didn't end well, but the nature of the responses were more or less expected.  .  In your case, I'd start by apologizing for being selfish, and that you're absolutely willing to go for it. Tell her you're willing to do it, but slowly. Step by step. You want to give her the best possible experience possible, so you want to do it right the first time. Then follow up on it.

They do sometimes come up for sale. However, you do run the risk of the feds taking notice and taking the car if you're unlucky. Personally I'm not willing to run that risk, but some are. Expect them to be quite expensive if/when they are sold.  Other things to note are that parts specific to the ST205, specifically brakes and suspension, are going to be almost completely ridiculously difficult to obtain. Engine parts shouldn't be -too- hard to find if needed, but you may have to order from overseas at some points, or at least a specialist shop that stocks parts for people who have swapped to 3rd and 4th-gen 3SGTEs.

"""The beauty of CB is the flexibility of the weapon. Have a hammer bro? Go for tail. Have a GS? Go for head to KO. Have both? Go for feet and get trips. You can go for big hits and KOs or you can stay in in sns mode forever with a status CB. Fill whatever role the team needs and you'll be guaranteed better clear times and more broken parts. I try not to overlap because CB is very prone to tripping, but with good positioning, you can easily share a head with hammer if you really need the KO.   Also a word of caution with GPs, while there are people with the requisite skill, I tend to not use them online unless I'm in a bad spot. It's fine to try to style on the monster solo, but if I miss the GP online, I'll get hit, be in axe mode when I get out, and get hit by a follow up attack because Im too slow. Definitely carted to this many times. Most of the time after you get a GP, you should be looking to evade the next attack since monsters get so aggressive in g rank. Thus, you probably shouldn't have been there in the first place. I try to combo such that it takes me through and past the monster. For example, there's an opening head on, X+A to dash in -&gt; charge A-&gt; X+A-&gt;X+A -&gt; R to charge shield-&gt; evade forward. That should take you all the way through the monster and a good distance behind him. The side evades are great for this too.

"""I am glad that this group notices this.  When I see this article, I sigh because it sucks this guy or group may owe this much in taxes.  I feel sick.  It is organized theft from the government and no one is really pissed about it.  And it actually kind of goes to the absurdity of our progressive personal income tax system.  Pseudo percentage based tax system.   But there are a couple of big issues with taxes.     *  First, everyone and even some dumb rich people advocate for ... higher taxes on the rich.    Why is this bad?  See my second point.     * Second, where do taxes go?  They go to the biggest pyramid scheming, mega-corporation, trillion dollar budget, war machine that is our US government.     The US federal government and its reckless spending has reached astronomical heights with zero accountability.    It is kind of shocking and people want to tax more  and give the government more money.  Really, people just want to tax the rich.  That is the goal.  It doesn't matter where the money is going.  They want the rich to have less.  Which is a pretty dumb line of thinking.  Just because you tax the rich doesn't mean you automatically gain.  If you tax Soros 7 billion, doesn't mean you get 50k in your pocket.  It is really a dumb line of thinking and completely irrational.  I hate when people on the ""left"" advocate for higher taxes and don't really say why.  Some might get into the debt and social security costs and all of that, but my response to that is, well what about government spending?  Why don't we NOT spend 600 billion on defense?  All that to say, I don't get mad that people evade taxes.  We should all get pissed that the government machine will take parts of your wealth.  And we don't know what Soros and these rich guys will do with the money.  They were pretty successful, they will probably invest it in another successful firm or project.  """,0

No English speaking notaire, then you find somebody to accompany you.  The bank has an English speaking service, but again, the state isn't paying for it.  As far as the state is concerned they expect you to learn, and if you need help it's either you pay or you throw yourself at someone's mercy and hope they do you a solid.

This is the usual route of WordPress plus pick a theme which suits you then tweak and launch. Alternatively, of course, you could look for overseas talent at places like odesk.   For what it's worth, I regularly talk to business owners in the LA area and technical talent is always the hardest to find. While a pile of resumes is just a craigslist ad away, finding business grade developers is another story, for which there are only a handful.   I would recommend attending some of the numerous developer/designer gatherings which occur in the LA area and meeting them. You have to consider that developers in demand are choosy about their clients -they generally don't respond to craigslist- so it helps to shake hands in person and convince them you would be an awesome client. They're interviewing you just as much as you're interviewing them. """,0

"""Yeah, it comes with 10 of them in yellow. It also a cool synth because it teaches you to let go - did a patch, had fun with it, and then you reset everything to make something new. Because of this it actually encourages experimentation.   Its inability to store patches is also its main drawback as it makes for a poor stage synth - you can only use it for one sound during your performance. Even though I've seen many big name artists use original ones on stage many people people ""grow out"" of them and move on to more advanced digital or digitally controlled synths.   Here are some actually some cool tips for it, which also show additional capabilities of the thing: https://youtu.be/jglbXy2tN20?list=PL2Y43eupOAVWhx_1j_VdvpYArHulB0c7m  Here is an official Korg demo that shows that it also can sound smooth: https://youtu.be/fSnzCWA_JWI  Another thing to mention: You seem fairly new to this synth game. So I just wanted to point out that many times synths are being paired with reverb and delay, just like in the video you found. It gives them more body and spaciousness. If you'll find your synth sounding ""stale"" and you use an amp you can also get a Zoom MS-70CDR pedal which features decent emulations of many popular effects.  Just don't get fixed on effects pedals and shit. A proper synth can actually fake many of them. Or more like a good synth programmer can. Just focus on learning synthesis and you will achieve great results. Don't worry if you can get good or memorable sounds out of your synth at first - it will come with experience. And don't think you've reached the limits of the synth - there is always more.  PS: As an example of a latter statement, I got my hands on one of them Volca Keys synths and to me it seemed more like a toy - a very simple and limited synth. I thought: not much can be done with it. And then: https://youtu.be/0WpZZjy8MkU, https://youtu.be/__C4pICe83U and https://youtu.be/GYLRtWk9wgE.""",0

If a sniper takes even a measureable amount of time to flick onto target, they're probably legit, solely because most hacks aren't programmed with a delay between flicking and landing a headshot.  And the spectate system in TF2 is really weird. You'll see a sniper aim very obviously below or above someone's head, but they'll get a headshot. From my understanding, this is because the server doesn't show you exactly where people are aiming when scoped, but show you a rough approximation.   Lag does come into play as well.

Birth control is a pretty significant factor, and on that score it's not even as simple as ""don't have sex.""   Maybe you've gotten the impression that liberals are a-okay with all those problems.  They're not, at all.  The difference is that (some) liberals recognize them as symptoms of broader issues.  And many of those broader issues are the result of long term policies which were put in place or are maintained out of racism.  That's the ""legacy"" people are always going on about.  So what's wrong with addressing those problems, too?  My concern here is that you seem to be saying those other things don't exist.   Now, our disagreement *should be* over how to address these systemic issues.  As a conservative, I'm sure you're against government programs that attempt to tackle poverty (and depending on the program, I might be too).

"""Despite what many think, the story of Civil War isn't about secret identities. Few key Marvel characters actually maintain a strict secret identity in the modern era. Many, like Cap, abandoned them years ago. The story *is* about the changing views of the audience, traditional superhero characters and stories versus modern tastes and sensibilities.  Prior to the Standford incident, superheroes were largely unofficially recognized by local, state, or federal government. Vigilantism is technically illegal, especially in a manner most superheroes (be they Marvel or DC) carry themselves. And they also commit crimes like assault, battery, and even criminal confinement.  We the audience and many people in the stories accept this as part of superheroics. Cops let the behavior slide because it is seen as a benefit to society. But the Stanford incident changed perception of this behavior in the Marvel U.  Tony understood the changing political climate and predicted that the populace would not tolerate traditional superheroics any longer. His support and leadership of the Registration Act was the logical evolution of heroes in this new world. It would allow heroes to do what they do best, but in an official capacity the people they claim to want to protect approve of. It was a necessary change that had to happen.  Cap, however, stood against it as a matter of personal rights and freedoms being attacked. That traditional ways were working just fine and one incident should not change this. His realization and surrender at the end of the story is rooted in how he finally realized that he was wrong. That he and his supporters were being rather selfish in their war.  Tony fought for change and the desires of the people. Cap and his team were fighting against change for their own selfish views and wants. The needs of the many versus the needs of the few.  Of course, the resulting infighting and chaos proved to be the end goal of the Skrull faction who wanted to weaken the bonds of the superhero community in order to successfully invade and conquer Earth. But this hardly changes the personal views of characters like Tony and Steve.""",0

The reason it didn't get a 10 is because it was so rushed and confusing. &gt;  &gt; **Art: 9**  &gt; The art also deserves a 10, but the reason it didn't get it was because it's kind of a particular art style. It's like, you like it or you hate it. &gt;  &gt; **Sound: 10**  &gt; The music was awesome. The voice actors were impressive. (Marry's scream at the end!) &gt;  &gt; **Character: 10**  &gt; While in the beginning the characters seemed stereotypical and boring, by the last episode, I was impressed with the amount of development each one's personality had. &gt;  &gt; Overall, I did really enjoy this anime. &gt;  &gt;Sayonara,  &gt; [USERNAME]  &gt; **Overall Rating: 9**  ****  **Review #2: [Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei) (TV)**    &gt; its just a bull shit &gt; the whole anime (dropped at ep 15) &gt;  &gt; **plot 210** &gt;  &gt;  &gt; 1.the mc - bla bla bla iam weak iam weak cause i cant move a wooden block! &gt; its doesnt even matter that i can cancle people magic(without super tec like every normal ""magician""), can fly (no one can),  &gt; 2.the mc is the best enginer in the world (heard about something that cannot figure out how to do in 20 years, makes it possible in half a day)  &gt; 3.to obvius that he would always win they didnt even try to make the battle looks like he have no chance (not like u have some battles most of the anime its usless talk)  &gt; 4.80% of the episods they just explain u wats happend but no one rly care about it its just to booring honestly (i watched (Zetsuen no Tempest) and this anime is perfect and its have a conversation about 3 episodes in a row,but Zetsuen no Tempest have an idea of something real u can imagining it by ur self u ur self can think about it and say its rly are a nice idea but...). &gt; in this magic anime the whole idea is a shit and they every f*cking episode trying to explain u wats happened he used magic left then down and he knokout him like that then some imaginary magic power interfere with some electricity vibrathion and he got knok out the whole anime and always the same &gt; the mc heard about flying magic (they said all the sienciest in the world trying to figure it out for years) &gt; he goes home make some shit and in the evening he can fly GG plot best plot ever &gt;  &gt;  &gt; **characters 210** &gt;  &gt;  &gt; u the main characters is the super boy and his sister &gt; the story foces only them to show us how perfect they are as long as i saw till ep 15 u got nothing new about them u just can see more and more how much they are good and perfect and every one else suck... &gt; the other characters side are just noisence u also didnt rly get their story and they are relevent only to show as the differences between the mc and their power the mc always win agains them he always the best in every way... &gt;  &gt;  &gt; **music 810** &gt;  &gt; i dont rly care about the sound so that just fine &gt;  &gt; **animation 810** &gt;  &gt; the animation style is also normal &gt; nothing special &gt;  &gt; **enjoyment 310** &gt;  &gt; honestly i just make my self watch it &gt;  &gt; **total 310** &gt;  &gt; so if u wanna anime that only talk 90% then the mc make some ""magic"" and win in instant go a head its for u... the only reason i didnt droped that earlier is cause i tough maybe it would go better but i tought so on ep 4 then in 10 and i got sick of it and dropped it at ep 15 &gt;  &gt; btw why is that tag as romance as long as i saw ep 15 i onlly saw sister complex with her brother if that a romance so oh shit nigga wtf?  &gt; **Overall Rating: 3**  I'll like to repeat myself by saying that the only edits I do on the reviews are formatting, spoiler tags, and cutting out the usernames.

"""Amiibos are physical figurines that you can [buy from retail stores](https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo).  On the title screen of Hyrule Warriors, you can place an Amiibo on the bottom-left corner of your Wii U Game Pad to receive a free gift. You can scan up to 5 Amiibos per day.  * Link Amiibo / Toon Link Amiibo: Unlocks Link’s Spinner weapon. Subsequent uses will give you a Link weapon with 3+ stars. * Zelda Amiibo: Gives you a Zelda weapon with 3+ stars. * Sheik Amiibo: Gives you a Sheik weapon with 3+ stars. * Ganondorf Amiibo: Unknown as of this date, but presumably, it should give you a Ganondorf weapon with 3+ stars. * Other Amiibos: Gives you Rupees, Materials, or a random weapon.  Normally, the Zelda-related Amiibos will grant you a rank 3 weapon for that specific character. However, Amiibos cannot grant you weapons you have not unlocked. For example, if you have a Sheik Amiibo, and you’ve only unlocked Sheik’s rank 2 weapon (Typhoon Harp), you will only receive Typhoon Harps from your Sheik Amiibo. You must unlock Sheik’s rank 3 weapon (Triforce Harp) from the Adventure Map before your Sheik Amiibo can give you Triforce Harps.  And if you haven’t unlocked Zelda, Sheik, or Ganondorf as characters, their corresponding Amiibos will give you a random prize as if they were a normal Amiibo.  You receive an ingame Medal for scanning 100 Amiibos called the Amiibo Warriors Medal.""",0

The MINI represents a nice balance between driver's car and economy car considering the supercharger, brilliant steering feel, racing competitiveness, and passable fuel efficiency. I also work on my own car and like to tinker, so the car is relatively cheap to maintain and relatively cheap to modify for a bit more power. In the end, I couldn't be happier even though I spent a few extra bucks, but recognize that this was a worthwhile trade off for me whereas it may not have been for others with different skill sets and interests.

I'd wager most people's anecdotal experience skews their perception of how many people wanted kids from their youth.  Remember, when you (or anyone) was growing up, you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids.  You didn't see many of the people that didn't want kids because they did not want to be around you.  That can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually.  When you reach adulthood, you see all the people that don't want kids because they aren't actively avoiding you anymore.  That could account for some of the perceived change.  """,0

Now is a game with skewed players, so the reciprocating revenge rules should be suspended or applied less.  Even if it doesn't instantaneously benefit us, an unexpected support will benefit us more because it won't cost us anything, it will generate positive value for someone else who have some set of interests aligned with us, so that we might get a return somewhere down the line.

Your reasons either apply to both, or neither. Pick one.  &gt;in all of the stupid news video, you don't see any penetration, just the implication of penetration, so there is more evidence to it not being rape.

"""It's an exercise in semantics showing that you can't say that the average player in league X makes the average wage in league X. That's what OP said, and that's what I've been refuting.  More broadly, talking about averages with a set like salaries is only useful at the collective level, and largely meaningless at the level of individuals.  Try this on: The average salary in MLS is higher than the J-League, but the average J-league player earns more than the average MLS player.  Can that be true?  Yes, and I think it actually *is* true. DPs in MLS skew the average up, so while the average in MLS might be higher than the J-League, the median in the J-League might be higher than MLS.

By stating my opinion I am not convincing you unless you share my perspective, as stated I didn't share it. I wanted his sources which allowed him to come to his conclusion so I can re-evaluate myself.  The danger of having to do your own research based on the opinions of others is your own inherent bias effecting how you respond to it. The evidence which convinced them should help convince or at the very least self-question.  Another danger is my opinion, a part of me, something which Google knows about so if the thing is up for debate I will receive sources I WANT, not the sources I should find.  And finally, the reason I prefer getting a source is the additional depth. We have opinions on facts, regardless of their absoluteness we all have different opinions many of which are far too long on complex to type out, by posting the sources and further reading if a replier is truly interested in debate they can see my expanded viewpoint easily with a well researched backing to better explain why I feel this way.  For example.  I believe 9/11 was an inside job.  Now firstly, if you Googled that you'd get a miriad of different websites claiming different things with different sources and more importantly a casm of differing definitions of inside job and to the extent and level. Now you could find backing up, but you're opinion wouldn't change because of the variety and your own personal bias which already knows such a thing exsists.  Now if I where to state my opinion in-depth with facts and sources backing up that exact position you'd get a better picture of my perspective allowing you to participate in a debate in which we can convey our own conclusions and the underlying evidence behind them. Hopefully with one of us changing their perspective.  If you did your own personal research you'd find plenty of sources but highly doubt you'd come to the same conclusion and certainly wouldn't change your perspective.

What I took from the Twitter post was less about global market value, and more about how much money a team was willing/allowed to invest in players. ** That's really what drives the global market too right? As Barca, Real Madrid, Man U, Bayern, etc. battle it out for a GREAT player, his price will rise.   So if a MLS team was willing/allowed to invest more money into its players, they could have more players with a higher perceived value (like what if the All-Star team was a team). The hope being that this would improve their overall quality and depth.   **Tangent**: I'm not against this, I do worry that it would unbalance the teams and make the league less enjoyable overall, but that's just based on my personal viewing preference. But it would help in some of these international competitions...  **2nd point**: Yes.

If you take it out of the *gay marriage* context, I think you will understand and maybe even appreciate Catholic sentiment.  As an example, the Parliament of England by [Act of Supremacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy) declared Henry VIII head of the Church of England.  I think most people probably already know the story, and how it was just a ploy to allow Henry to annul his marriage with Catherine so he could marry Anne Boleyn.  *Saint* Thomas More was canonized (at least partly) because he would not take the Oath of Supremacy, believing Parliament had no jurisdiction over issues which were God's alone.

"""&gt; how is it that the German car manufacturers there have been so slow to go electric?  They probably know the German market.  My first guess is the population density in Germany compared to the US. It's 226 per km² or 583 per square mile in contrast to 34.2 per km² (88.6 per square mile) in the US. As a consequence, most people live in urban environments, ie. flats. It's hard to put solar on your roof when you don't own the roof. Charging at home becomes a problem when your car has no fixed parking space.  My second guess is the vacation culture. Our annual vacations are kind of a big deal here where tons of people drive down to Italy, or Spain in the summer. Many of them use their own car. This is important for them, so range anxiety might be higher than in the US.  My third guess is an established car nut culture. There was once a test of car dealers with researchers pretending to be potential buyers asking for hybrids or electric cars. In the better cases, the sales men were ignorant. In the worst cases, they spread lies and falsehoods. Also, journalists in established magazine like Auto Motor Sport are sometimes skeptical about electric cars, to put it mildly.  Finally, from my personal point of view, the Model S may look awesome from the outside, but the interior is a bit too much like a US car, and these do not have have a very good reputation here.  So, hybrids are currently a better bet for car makers. """,0

"""It's not a strawman at all, you just don't seem to have actually thought out where your line of reasoning can lead or how it's related. You can claim there's 'obviously a difference' all you want, you are still using the same line of reasoning to completely invalidate what someone has to say based on some arbitrary checklist. The only kind of person who really doesn't need a say in this is someone who doesn't play games. This is a gaming-only problem. They can have a say if they want but it's going to be completely uninformed (unless they inexplicably read gaming sites/magazines despite not playing games). Anyone who plays games though should have every bit the same chance as anyone else in gaming to have their opinion judged by its merits and not because they don't meet arbitrary standards of being a 'modding community member'.   Edit: I should clarify, I'm not saying being someone who plays games means you will undoubtedly be informed of the situation but at least concerns about it would be valid compared to concerns from someone who has absolutely zero stake in it because they don't play games and the situation is not posed to present any change to any systems outside of games.  &gt; Or things like ""mods always have been free and should be free!"" which is likely because they themselves don't want to pay for them.   Which is a valid opinion. The fact that you're treating it like it's not is pretty disturbing. Almost as disturbing as implying that not rating or donating makes them 'not part of the community'.   &gt;As for Valve's reasoning for pursuing this possibility, neither you nor I know that, and to credit it to the dude that clicked the ""download"" link on a couple pages on Nexus Mods seems overly generous in my opinion.  Economics 101. If it didn't look like a viable and highly profitable venture then a company like Valve wouldn't be touching it. Seeing the number of downloads and attaching a dollar sign to it is the catalyst for things like paid mods happening. You think their exorbitantly high cut was just to cover server and hosting costs? Hell no, they saw great potential for profit because modding is a populous and thriving community. """,0

I think what you mean is that the amount of suffering could be plotted along a continuum, but this gets quite complicated as we all can struggle at times when deciding which harm is worse than others. Took me a while to understand your last sentence. You're saying that not only should [we] make the choice to eat the best thing possible at present, but we can also seek the best. Yep that's fair, I didn't mean to imply that your framework didn't support constant improvement, I only meant to point out that it's unlikely in this economy (dominated by capitalism) that say grain production will ever evolve to be farmed veganically if we stop eating it all together and get our calories form say honey (ignore the details of the simplification).  But I think my point still stands that under your framework you are obliged to find and locate the best minimal set (can include variety as long as they are of the same level) of nutritionally complete calorie sources and only consume that.  Doesn't really seem that practical as each local[e] will have a different set depending on which crops they can grow etc. There will also be differing opinions about what's healthy. That's why veganism isn't just a philosophy, political statement, but also comes with guidelines to make it easy to follow practically. We simply can't have a cohesive baseline under your framework, imagine how much dissent there would be at a potluck. :P""",0

"""I got this sump as part of a good deal for a few tanks and stands from a friend who couldn't keep them anymore.    It has got a small protein skimmer (big enough for my tank) built in.  I'm torn between setting up a 37g reef using this sump tank (If I can ever find a replacement tank that fits this stand…) and just getting one of the 29g biocubes where everything is contained in the back of the tank.  Obviously the biocube sounds a lot easier, but I don't mind some extra work.  Hell, I already own the sump tank, so I'd really like to use it because I know they aren't exactly cheap and I don't want to waste it.  Of course I could just save it for when I have room for a bigger tank...    My options for my first reef tank are pretty much the following:  1) buy new glass, a pump, bio media, and plumbing for the sump.  (I'd love a bigger tank but a 29-40g would be about all I can fit in my apartment.)  or  2) just go for the 29g biocube where all of the filtration is built in.  It will cost close to the same to go either way.  I just can't decide if it's worth trying to make what I already have work or just doing with something entirely different.

"""&gt; On the other hand I would like to point out an aspect about this story and its relation to time. Does it have to refer to the state of beings way back then?  Joseph Campbell exposed me to this very idea: that the Garden exists not *out there* in some past geographical location, but within each and everyone of us. And though the Bible narrative tells us we are forever expelled, I believe this is a test, and if we can overcome the fear of losing these meaningless labels, we can return to the Garden anytime and experience a state of pure Being. This is what being present is all about. The Power of Now is there for all of us to grasp, at will, if only with a little practice :)  And your point about children is spot on. I have two of my own and watching them grow and develop has really helped me understand some fundamentals. For instance, the illusion of time. My oldest is five and if I tell her to wait fifteen minutes, she just barely understands what that means. Every two minutes she asks me, ""Is it time yet?"" Time--or clock time, at least--is learned. Which means it doesn't ""exist"" in any meaningful way. Same with all these labels! My youngest pulls hair, hits, pinches, and laughs her little face off. She isn't concerned with ""right"" or ""wrong,"" she's simply testing out cause and effect.   &gt; We put this grid over nature, and then we label each square so that we can tell ourselves that we know something about it.  I still think there is a purpose and need for this. The problem arises when we forget that the grid isn't real, just a tool for navigating and manipulating Reality. They are useful but not necessary, and they certainly aren't rigid or concrete. Even so, there are patterns in the dance of matter and energy, of ever-shifting forms, and we have the ability to pick out these patterns, analyze and learn from them, and in this the human animal--however you define it--is unique.

"""I love these giveaways you're such an awesome person for doing this and though my chances of winning are very slim, I just appreciate that you still give me a chance. I'm 15 years old, I try to collect amiibo as best as I can, I'm not a NiB collector as I like to spend time with my little brother training (Note: Smash is the only game we play) them with my little brother up to level 50 and put them on our own amiibo tournaments. It's a hobby we both share. Sadly, because of Nintendo and it's attitude for Amiibo, I nor my brother are able to get amiibo we most want, Ike being one that my brothers want and Shulk the one I want (My dick friend bought a $30 Shulk from Amazon fully knowing that I wanted him and couldn't get him, he gloated about it for a week and is now gloating about his greninja). All the amiibo I have I bought with my own money (I used to work in a pizzaria shop because my father was good friends with the owner but they recently closed so I dont have a job anymore) I got extremely lucky with my unicorns (they were hidden behind some skylanders in Walmart), my parents are Mexican so they don't give a damn about my obsession with amiibo, heck they don't care about my hobbies, they also will NOT buy me anything that is video game related, I had to save up for everything(me and my sister together saved up for a Wii U). I was lucky with Captain Falcon, he was super cheap ($15) on Amazon and I bought him without my dad's permission. He got pissed but not too pissed. Either way, I just spent my last 60 dollars on wave 4 for me and my brother, didn't have enough for Charizard or Wario that was money I saved up for splatoon but both me and my brother wanted the new wave. Again, my chances of winning is slim but in the rare case you pick me, my brother would like the Ike and give the WFT to someone who really wants it. Again I really appreciate you for doing this giveaway, it always gives me a bit of hope in my heart.                                                    Thank you /u/Thehunterforwonder""",0

"""The same reason why people aren't overreacting to Mariota's 2 INTs. I guess teams think each QB's performances were all about the kind of system they were in.  We saw Foles run a similar system as Mariota/Oregon in the NFL and finish with only 2 INTs one season, but the next season his INT count was much higher. Teams know that if they run a spread system similar to what Mariota was in, they probably aren't going to see his insane TD-INT ratio because NFL defenses have rapidly evolved.  Now take a look at Winston. Teams know what to expect from him because he was in a true pro system, and he finished with 25 TDs to 18 INTs. Which means teams are probably expecting roughly the same kind of performance in his rookie NFL season. If he does have 25-18 again, that would put him in a very similar range as the rookie seasons of Luck, Wilson, and Dalton - all three of which led their teams to playoff appearances.""",0

You might have a point here, though I doubt their very specific alleged belief that waiting periods are against their region for abortions is sincere.  I assure you the members are very sincere. The third tenet of The Satanic Temple is ""One's body is inviolable, subject to one's own will alone"". This is taken very seriously. When the state imposes completely unnecessary obstacles to obtaining a legal abortion for the sole purpose of discouraging the free exercise of that right, with no other basis than the personal beliefs of the Christian majority in the state, it is a gross violation of her religious belief of the inviolability of her bodily autonomy.

"""While it depends on the world you are playing, from what I understand in Golarion necromancy pulls souls out of Phrarasma's boneyard before they can be judged. When an undead dies, its soul is destroyed.  The problem is the lesser god Groetus who hangs out above the boneyard. When the last soul is judged, Groetus descends on the boneyard which starts the end times. Pharasma keeps away Groetus by feeding him the souls of atheists.   So every time you raise the dead you bring the world one step closer to a permanent end. That is why creating undead is evil.   In general resurrection spells bring the soul back to life and usually is treated as it wasn't the soul's time yet. A resurrected character's soul still goes to the boneyard when it dies.  There are such things as non-undead necromancy. Essentially necromancy spells that don't deal with creating undead deal with the forces of life and death. Stuff like blindness/deafness, bestow curse and disrupt undead are under necromancy. Usually necromancy involves negative energy as well and as long as you aren't using it to heal the undead I don't see a problem with it.

I start out in what seems to be the Amazon, like the trees and rivers. But they are Islands similar to the floating ones in Avatar. (I was having these dreams before the films but they are the closest thing visually) .Except the river is very straight, canal like. I'm floating down it as it gets faster and faster. I'm joined but random people I can't recognise, but they are floating down with me. There is no visible floating device. The river is straight but the trees and vines turn around me. Soon this ride takes me off the edge into the longest drop I ever seen. Its an almost perfect circle down, I can see other straight rivers entering from the sides. I fall down, I keep falling for a while. Then fade I to black, when I wake up, I'm wet and I'm down a street. The but there is only 3 houses I see, I'm encapsulated in a box, the blue walls go all around with room to spare. I get out of the gutter and walk to the first house in front of me. I peer through the window. There is a family inside, all happy, like Christmas dinner time. But not, one of the older children turn to look at the window and they see me. She screams, the while family looks over and they start panicking. I get worried and jump back, looking around. There is a mirror just floating between the house. I stand in front of it and look. I can't describe what I see, but it brings me to tears instantly. I cry desperately to this mirror, sobbing into my limbs (sometimes hands, othertimes tentacles, once wood). I sit down on the curb outside these 3 houses still crying where the youngest child comes over to me and puts a hand on my shoulder. At this point, it feels like the camera ending as I can see the child resting the hand on the thing and I pan up into the darkness where I wake up.  I don't know why I have this dream, it happened once to twice a year for majority of my life, not had it for 2 years but it sticks with me still.""",0

No need to amputate! Wow! Modern medicine rules! It's way better than bronze age medicine, which is what you're advocating.  &gt; peace of mind that comes with knowing they have the penis that women prefer?  Hmm. The penis version of Pascal's Wager. Way to go. I like how you're advocating cutting up someone's body without permission based on the hypothetical assumption that a hypothetical mate would hypothetically prefer it.

I've alleviated this issue with myself by smoking while I cook dinner. I eat a relatively healthy meal right as the munchies kick in, and I am good for the rest of the night. If you time your smoking with your meals, I expect it will be less of a problem. And planning ahead to have healthy snacks around could also help.

Pipe tobacco and cigars I can understand as they have decent flavors and can even smell pleasant to those around. But I've never smelt cigarette smoke that didn't make me think of a fat ladies ass.

"""&gt; Yes, but we have been discussing about whether or not bans on polygamy would pass rational basis review.  No you have been doing that. I don't think you can even begin discussing the notion of rational basis until you have a clear understanding of what marriage is. I don't even think it is the right way to think about the problem to begin with.  The only thing I have said on the matter is that I don't think the legislative difficulties imposed by polygamy are a big deal.  ---------------  &gt; Fortunately, the law is judged from the standard of a reasonable person.   And this is the belief of reasonable people.  &gt; Believing that a gay couple getting married ""damages the dignity of their marriages"" is a subjective rather than objective belief.   And believing that marriage grants any kind of dignity is also a subjective determination.  Reasonable gay people believe they are being denied dignity, and reasonable straight people believe that granting gay marriage damages their dignity.""",0

"""Hey hey, as a final year medical student I can confirm that shadowing isn't really something that is done here per se, but there are opportunities down the line to get involved in emergency medicine.  Depending on which medical school you apply to, they will offer a variety of placements, some of which will be in various areas including emergency. That being said, I fell in love with emergency med within the first few years of my degree, but as a medical student we're really good at falling for almost every different type of specialty. I can guarantee that you will change your mind at least 5 times within your first semester at uni. As Mick_kerr's comment, try and enjoy your moment; get involved in the placement you're in.   If you're also undertaking rural terms, they can provide a really good hands on approach to working in a rural ED, where bulk interesting patients present.   Medical schools can also offer elective terms in the later years where you might be able to arrange with a particular department in any state to take a term (approx 6-8 weeks) with them. This is normally only later on in the degrees (years 5-6 in undergrad or years 3-4 in postgrad)  tl;dr concentrate on getting in to med school, enjoy the ride and don't forget to party on the weekends.

"""&gt; With every large title release there's no doubt that hundreds of thousands, if not millions, will have already purchased these games.  True. My point was that with so few games available currently - this is even *more* true and more of an issue.  &gt; The indie titles might be new to most because most people don't like indie games.  Or, you know, it could be because they don't have million dollar ad campaigns and aren't featured on blogs and websites on a weekly basis. Or the player simply doesn't care about or follow gaming blogs and news beyond whatever game their friend showed them.  Sure, there are people that don't like 'indie' games... Which I don't understand as a blanket statement since 'indie' is not a genre... but that doesn't mean *most* people don't like them. But yes, it's true that some people just want awesome 3d graphics that are gritty and real and guns and blood and anything but something that might be seen as 'cartoony' or 'for kids'.   &gt;The gaming population would be better off with higher quality titles that a lot of people already own as opposed to a shitload of crappy indie titles nobody even want to own.  First off, it's your *opinion* that higher production values equate to *higher quality* games. I strongly disagree, as AAA game design is largely redundant and uninspired. Secondly, you're assuming/projecting that these indie games are crappy and that *most people* don't like them.  Overall, I just simply disagree with you. Giving away a game that's been out for over a year - that everyone already knows about - that has already been purchased by the people who are actually interested - is simply not-enticing. Nor does it really help the developer in any meaningful way aside from getting that cut that Sony gives to developers/publishers of the games on the IGC.  Whereas, giving away a handful of indie games that are lesser known gives us an opportunity to discover something we didn't even know about that might actually pleasantly surprise us. When a game does appeal to people, this causes them to start telling their friends about this lesser-known title, garnering more interest... which could, very likely, result in a lot more actual purchases after their IGC month because the word-of-mouth recommendations are slowly spreading out to those never knew about it. This helps these struggling developers (and usually actually go to the developers themselves) far more than the AAA publishers.  """,0

Teams like TSM ban their players from reading reddit for a reason. If social media isn't helping you, if your fanbase is nonexistent, don't bother logging into twitter or facebook to view death threats and people calling you trash.   &gt;They have years and years of professional experience around them, trainers and players and coaches and all of these people that, should someone actually get down from what they're saying, there's an entire support staff around them. Sports psychologists and everything.  MOst LCS teams are already at this level though! LXGG, specifically, is on a team with Seraph, who had terrible nerve issues and issues facing the community. People still have the same tools to deal with these problems.   &gt;That player isn't in your living room hearing you say it. This player could be on reddit reading it.  Lol people in Philly chant ""EAGLES"" when the Phillies aren't doing good. Live crowd fans can be just as brutal as reddit.   &gt;You're making my point.  Not really. I'm pointing out that while people shouldn't say it, that it is going to happen and realistically, players need to learn how to deal with it. Without doing that, players are going to constantly cave to trolls and pressure.   And don't think that the community alone brings about this pressure, management can as well. Don't deceive yourself into LXGG not thinking this wouldn't happen.

Threw my shield at my opponent, who responded by reaching out and hitting my now exposed, unarmoured hand, and severed my left index finger. I was then taken into a nearby corporate lobby where I bled copiously over expensive Italian leather couches, then on to RPA hospital where I was the first sword related injury in over 100 years. Only part of the incident I remember is looking at where my finger was now hanging by a single tendon, seeing the bone and spurting blood, and saying,  ""That'll need stitches"".

"""I have seen a lot of these ""chance me"" posts on SDN and I really don't think anyone can offer a definitive answer either way.  That being said, I have been where you are and have benefitted a great deal from the advice and perspectives of others who were there before me.  So based on my experience applying, doing a lot of reading about applying, and speaking with others, a few points come to mind for you.    Firstly, your experience is great.  A lot of applicants focus on research or clinical experience and you have both.  It sounds like you have this aspect of your application down.  You will have great stories for your app essays and be able to earnestly describe your interest in dentistry to interviewers.  Secondly, your GPA isn't amazing, but it also isn't bad.  It certainly won't disqualify you, given your experience.  I have heard anecdotally that schools prioritize GPA above experience.  Perhaps a great GPA can even outweigh a lack of experience because it shows that you can handle the academic rigor of dental school.    Which, brings me to my last point: On the other hand, since your GPA is not amazing, you need to show that you have mastered the basic science curriculum that is the foundation of what you will learn in dental school.  Unfortunately, your only option (other than taking more classes and raising your GPA) is to dominate the DAT.    Your DAT score needs to improve.    Some schools have a cutoff where they will not accept an applicant with scored in any section under 17.  Your chances are not great right now.  You might get interviews, you may even get in, but the standards for admission to dental school are against you.   But that's okay!!!  Because you can improve your chances. So don't rule yourself out, just do some serious soul searching, dig deep down and find the will to come back and dominate the DAT.  The fact that you rushed through the last section is indicative to me that you weren't prepared.  Ask yourself what this path and career means to you and if it means enough, then use your willpower to sacrifice and study hard.    Make a plan.  Remove all distractions and obligations. Take 6 weeks off and study every single day.  Grab some exercise and see a friend or SO now and again, but make it your life's mission to succeed on the DAT.    I believe that you want to become a dentist.  I believe that you will make the choices you need to get there.  I believe in you.   Now go get it!!! :)""",0

Hypotheses on possible infections are supported by the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with increased risk of developing MS (Levin et al., 2003). Lang and colleagues (2002) proposed cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors (TCR) to DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) and DRB5*0101-restricted EBV peptide as the mechanism behind the increased risk. In addition to possible molecular mimicry, EBV infected B-cells have been found in the meninges and post-mortem brains of MS patients and not in other neurological inflammatory diseases (Serafini et al., 2007).   The pathological processes of MS encompass inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, oligodendrocyte depletion, astrocytosis, neuron and axon degeneration, which ultimately result in the formation of sclerotic plaque in the CNS (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).  Migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) is believed to initiate the disease process, though research attempts to identify whether the BBB is dysfunctional prior to immunocellular infiltration. Altered haemorheology, leading to ischemic injury of the cerebral microvasculature, has been proposed as a mechanism for BBB dysfunction (Ballabh, Braun, &amp; Nedergaard, 2004). The extravasation of the T lymphocytes is achieved through the interaction of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon γ (INF-γ) with endothelial adhesion molecules LFA-1 and VLA-4 (Engelhardt, 2006). Th17 lymphocytes may then secrete IL-17, under macrophage mediated IL-23 control, which together with lymphocytic IL-22 disrupts the BBB, allowing T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). While the antigenic target not fully established, it is likely the MBP and the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Moreover, an autoimmune response against the αB crystalline chaperone proteins prevents physiological suppression of cerebral inflammation (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008) and autoantibodies against neurofascin-155 and neurofascin-186, which are important for cell migration and adhesion in the CNS, mediate axonal injury (Mathey et al., 2007).  The accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory mediators exacerbate the immune response through the recruitment of naive microglia. Microglia are then activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and bind to the myelin-oligodendrocyte complex, previously opsonised with Fc fragments of antibodies and complement molecules. Microglial phagocytosis of the myelin sheath occurs upon surface-bound TNFα signal transduction (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) accumulate in the CNS further contributing to myelin and axon damage (Ortiz et al., 2014). While action potentials may depolarise demyelinated axon regions, conduction of these impulses occurs at reduced speeds (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).  In progressive MS, demyelination coexists with diffuse neurodegeneration associated with the build-up of insoluble tau (Bartosik-Psujek &amp; Archelos, 2004). B lymphocyte infiltrates accumulate in the meninges, leading to intrathecal antibody production (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

I personally admit that biology isn't as hardcore as physics, so it just kinda rubs me the wrong way when psych majors want to consider themselves hard scientists, yet when you compare the courses of study, psych is simply not as rigorous.  Yeah, that's probably a bigoted view I'm guilty of holding, but I'm proud of the work I put into my degrees and when someone suggests that they are my equal when they haven't put in as much work as I have, I get worked up.

"""I only point out that this is america because what works in another country may not necessarily work here, not cause murica. If family leave affects both genders and men have it worse how can you use it as an example of female oppression?  My point is that rape isn't a gender issue and it isn't oppression either.  I've never had to see a gynecologist so I can't speak on how easy it is to get an appointment but I can't agine it being any more difficult than scheduling any other Dr appointment.  Roe vs wade may get challenges but its still the law of the land, healthcare in general is expensive so I don't see how that is oppression either. As far as birth control goes there's plenty of inexpensive options and really no excuse since the primary purpose of vaginal intercourse is reproduction, people who are unwilling or unable to raise a child should practice abstinence rather than expecting the rest of society to pay for their birth control so they can have all the sex they like without consequence. If you're having sex you take on the possibility of a pregnancy it's not an accident I don't understand why people want to relieve themselves of responsibility for their actions.  Maybe I'm not recalling correctly on the domestic violence thing I do recall clearly seeing that women are the purpotratirs more often than men and they also tend to use weapons like knives, so I'd say men get hurt worse than women do.  Well women are generally way more emotional than men are so PMS or not you never know how much of what they're saying is truth and how much is exaggeration and drama.  Mansplain is a word made up to silence opposing views when men try to have a say in gender discussions, within the feminist movement men are constantly marginalized and dismissed, because equality. I'm coming into a female dominated apace to offer a different point of view. See you can class men dismiss women because of their gender but that is bullshit women get just as much respect as men do bases on what they're saying. If a woman is spouting crap that is incorrect or irrational then of course shell be dismissed the same as any man doing the same.  I was talking historically in response to the notion that women couldn't so things men could, it worked both ways and it wasn't just women who were forced into certain roles but that never gets brought up because if it was the case for men and women then you can't use it as proof of women being oppressed in the past. If histrionic has gendered connotations I'm not aware of it.  What I've learned from your post - women are somehow oppressed in the first world yet you can't give a single example of it, what you have given is issues that both men and women deal with being appropriated as affecting women only or  affecting women worse and complaining because society is supporting women with free/cheap birth control and healthcare.""",0

As for dull skin, I would try out some sort of exfoliation such as Mizon 8% AHA Serum, COSRX AHA Whitehead Power Liquid or Cure Aqua Gel. Vitamin C serums would probably also help with both hyperpigmentation and dull skin so that's definitely worth a look over.""",0
"""&gt; It doesn't work like that. If they would label her as enemy or have any negative thoughts about her (like even ""I don't like her make-up""), they would be knocked down.  Well, Cherish is screwed, petty teenager that she is. You've still got Gray Boy as being effectively immune, as well as probably Mannequin and maybe Night Hag - Mannequin doesn't actually need air so I'm not sure exactly what stripping away oxygen in his blood would do, and Night Hag isn't human. Siberian also may or may not be effected - I don't know what she does when Manton is sleeping, and I don't know if he would even be hit. King might be able to pass on the effect to a pawn - his power was able to do it with Gray Boy's loops, so it works on pretty abstract types of ""harm."" Crawler's thoughts would be more ""play with me!"" than any sort of ill will towards her, and Bonesaw's would be along the lines of ""you're so cool! I can't wait to look inside your head!"" but I don't know how abstract you want to get with what her power defines as ""ill will."" Given Gray Boy's effective immunity, it doesn't really matter.  &gt;Siberian can be decomposed, since her power protects only against physical things. And he doesn't need line of sight.  She's immune to non-physical stuff like distorted time and, more importantly, Tatsuya has to identify the design of something before he can decompose it. That would cost him a precious second or two and would let the Hack Jobs teleport in to flip his powers off. Teleportation is instant, so his senses and reaction times shouldn't be able to stop it before it shuts him down.  &gt;Well, it may work, though Berserker gains resistance even if something doesn't kill him. God Hand is like fusion between powers of Crawler and Grey Boy.  The loop resetting should reset whatever resistance he gains, if it's a physical thing, or someone could simply go after Illya.  &gt;No, she is not. Saber is fast enough to essentaily be a teleporter for them. And how she reacts to GB is arguable.  Yeah, she sort of is screwed once Avalon is over, because she has no way to take down all of the 9000. If they wanted to, the Gray Boys could simply surround her in time loops while Avalon is up and that would be that. The loops are impassible to anyone but Gray Boy, so Saber's luck or instincts won't help her to escape them if she's already surrounded.  &gt;Cherish rather wont be able to find him, since he is not human anymore and even if she could, he can just turn into spirit and run away.  The bodies of Servants seem to operate the same way the bodies of normal humans do, for the most part, end even if they don't work exactly the same, she can sense case 53s and other not-quite-humans as well. I don't see why she wouldn't be able to sense him. Turning into spirit and running away is a valid plan, but then she would just search him down again.  &gt; If there is any way, Mitsuru takes it. Also OP haven't specified, that it has to be a head-on fight.  He's not specified as getting any prep, and they start in the same city. Unless the 9000 don't know they're in a fight for some odd reason, the Cherishes can work to hunt him down or Shatterbird can simply destroy the city and take him out that way.  &gt;Alessi's stand doesn't have to him opponent, but his/her shadow to work. And even if Siberian may be able to ignore it, Gray Boy cannot, since he has no protection from abilities, that turn time backwards.  Personally, I would argue that Gray Boy's ability to reset to a specific point in his own timeline would protect him from age reversal just as well as it would from any other power, but even if we assume it doesn't there's no way Alessi is going to take out every member fast enough to stop one of them from retaliating, especially given that he can't take out the Siberians.  &gt; Here is Kojou's wiki. He has some hax abilities like Grey Boy-like regen (that also allows him to turn things/people backwards in time), spatial erasure, obliterating several hundreds of kilometers with lighting and shields, that can resist even reality warping.  Looking at those familiars, just from the wiki I'll agree they could probably win if he pulled them out. The big threat to him would be Gray Boy putting him in a loop before he could summon one, as the looping would keep him from completing his chant. If he starts with the right familiars already out or if he starts out of sight somewhere, he should win.  &gt; Well, they can fly. And rift is created upon being struck with SCC beams.  Do you know if they're made of exotic materials? Shatterbird's scream would cripple them if they had silicon-based computers.  &gt; Well, thread is who can solo S9, not who can stomp it 10/10.

"""Choose a crafting class that can support the Disciples of War or Disciples of Magic classes that you're leveling. If you're leveling a tank or post-level 25 dragoon, an Armorer makes most of your armor. If bard, monk, or ninja, leatherworker for the armor. If a caster, weaver. The ""problem"" with this advice, however, is that your crafter will have to be almost the same level as your combat class to make level appropriate armor. Without the list of useful crafting skills listed by /u/Erik_Highwind it may be hard to HQ the gear  Also consider which classes make your weapons. Carpenter for dragoon, bard and whitemage; blacksmith for tank and ninja weapons, plus some monk and dragoon ones; goldsmith for blackmage weapons (and almost all accessories beyond lvl 29); leatherworker for some monk weapons; alchemist for some whitemage weapons and summoner, scholar books. I may have missed a few, you could browse the recipe book on ffxivcrafting.com to understand what each class makes.  Note that the above advice is not necessary for people who are leveling their first combat class. You get some gear every five levels. But it's nice, especially if you can make high quality gear. Firstly, HQ gear has slightly higher stats. Secondly, it spiritbonds faster. When gear is 100% spiritbonded, you can convert it into materia, which is bought and sold actively on the market board, occasionally for ridiculous prices. I'd hazard a guess that once you begin converting gear from the lvl 30-45 range, you'll start getting the occasional gem that sells well.   You could also choose to level a class that gets most support from the gatherer class you're leveling. Miners provide most of the materials for armorers, blacksmiths and gold smiths, while botanists supply carpenters, alchemists, culinarians, weavers. A fisher is more fun for world exploration than supplying mats. When I was leveling crafters and had to buy materials from the market board, I hated it when I was forced to buy overpriced things, or stacks of 99. This is where self sufficiency in material gathering is a plus.   The most significant boost to crafting xp comes from tradecraft courier leves, where you usually pick up the leve in a hub city, then turn in the crafted item in another area. If you HQ the item you get double the xp. I believe you'll need to do about 10 of these to advance five levels, so stock up on material accordingly. """,0

That was a livesteam though, Twitch is kind of a cesspool anyway so that's a low blow on them though, I guess?  The PK community is mostly where OSRS went though, and we've seen how aggressive people can get over PVP.   Anyway, RS3's community's still pretty shitty too but that's mostly shown out of at least a genuine concern. The most annoying thing I see about the community is their stupidity regarding MTX. Being against MTX is totally fine but some people just are dense as shit and refuse to accept being even slightly wrong, then you've just got people who are way too zealous and refuse to want to work with Jagex and instead go for a very ""NO MTX WHAT SO EVER GET RID OF IT NOWWWWWWW"" sort of approach.   But even those people, they're not assholes really, even the people who really aren't level headed and really have no idea what they're talking about (which is by no means all of them) are really just looking out for what they believe is best for the game anyway. . .   So compare that to what I've said about OSRS . . .   Obviously RS3' got my vote.   _____  Being a skiller on RS3? Easier or harder . . . Mm. I guess harder, depends? OSRS doesn't have dungeoneering, dungeoneering requires you to either pay people to let you leech or for you to participate in combat so if we consider that? I guess RS3's way harder, especially with 120 dungeoneering.  Overall I tend to think of, content wise anyway, OSRS v. RS3 like this, RS3 intends to add more and more updates, OSRS will add very sparse, polled updates. RS3 is already years ahead of OSRS content by it's very nature. . . RS3's going to not necessarily be harder or easier as much as it will be more expansive.  We've got [runespan](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Runespan) for runecrafting and you can make some good money on [vis wax](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Vis_wax) so I guess maybe it'd be easier to do it on RS3? The main thing I'm really not sure about is prices for OSRS, this is a huge deal for buyable skills and largely will dictate just how hard things are.

I listened to the whole podcast over the Christmas break with SO and we had been told to listen to it by a friend who was hooked while it was still ongoing.  That friend laid out the evidence of a false conviction and was in the innocent camp when they recommended so I had that in the back of my mind - the whole - there is this serial killer that is the one that actually did it story.  By the end, I was scratching my head.  I thought there was some huge exculpatory piece of evidence coming and I never heard it.  From how SK and Rabia described the prosecution and CG, I expected something much, much more than what was presented. Still, I was pretty sure he was actually guilty but the case was weak.  I was particularly interested in the cell data as I worked in RF and cell planning for many years.  After looking at the actual maps and reading the actual testimony, it is clear that the prosecution did not claim what Serial or the innocent camp said that they claims (being consistent with is not saying is it 100% proof the call was from LP).  Once I read the testimony, I concluded that everything AW testified to was correct.  After reading over the actual transcripts, I am firmly in the guilty camp.  I don't think it was a moment of passion, I think it was premeditated murder over Adnan's pride being hurt.  I think he is a complete liar and lacks and remorse for the crime so he deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail.  I actually feel bad for the people in the innocent camp at this point as they are blind to the manipulation.

But we don't have another Klein right now, just people who put ambition over responsibility.   I don't actually want any other party in power, but the PC's have to remember to represent us, not themselves. They're completely off the rails and need to be scared back on track. In Alberta, and in Ottawa too.   The WR would just be co-opted and ultimately strengthen the PC's, the Alberta party might as well not exist as it gets no traction in the shadow of the pc/wr's (too bad, because they're actually fairly reasonable), I'd wipe my ass with a ballot before I'd ever vote for the thieving Liberals, so that leaves me with the NDP, which makes me nervous, they have a history of ravaging provinces and are generally ridiculous.   But we DO need to play chicken with the PC's or they will never change.   This is a situation of driving home the point that a home needs to be renovated by tossing a moltov in the living room.

To give something an 8 and then have a completely thought process that manages to bring down your score in half is really odd, *especially* after the poor ending.

The real trick is knowing what to make of all the info received I.e. how to analyze and what it means. It's not really that hard actually, just can be a lot of material to figure out.  The most important part of the DD process,  and this is just my opinion, will be the phase after these intial questions,  the follow up questions.  Baaically after finding out some things,  knowing what to ask next to probe further is crucial, to determine if and how much risk there really is.  Finally, I should probably say from experience depending on the size of the transaction a lot of sellers will baulk at such a rigorous list of questions as above.  Which you cant really blame them if for example its a $10k deal, the time spent to get that all together wouldn't be worth it.

The second finals, Bjersen did better overall but Hai did great with his Zed too.

Dade season 4? Hai never died 1v1 but yes Dade won that matchup but thats like saying Bjergsen got destroyed by POE so he sucks. It happens. As for Xpeke in S3, again Hai did just fine in lane but Xpeke took over late game with his Kassadin. As Hai admitted, C9 made a huge mistake because they thought they could counter Kassadin despite it being a super strong champion that everyone was banning. That said, in that series, Hai was actually the one that mechanically outplayed Xpeke and got a 1v1 kill with his Fizz.  Hai is not weak mechanically, its how C9 plays. They just dont pressure mid and prefers to focus elsewhere because Hai used to be self sufficient. He would compensate for it by putting pressure all around the map at the expense of his lane. But now with most teams getting pretty good at vision game Hai cannot roam as effectively anymore, and with his team not adapting to pressure more in mid lane relative to how much pressure his opponents are getting, Hai has essentially been a sitting duck this split.  Anyways, just because some reddit guys like you says Hai sucks doesnt make it so. I would trust what pros like Shiphtur, Voyboy, and even Bjergsen says about Hai.""",0

She spontaneously called in for work that day (It was 5 am at the time) and sat in the parking lot of the birth center all day until 2pm when the boy was born. And of course she told me this, so it was in the back of my mind the entire time. (She wanted to come in and wait in the waiting room. No? I had no idea what was going to happen. Those sound proof doors are good but...things like the shower and stuff are on the other side. All I need would be for her to see me, run down the hall and engage.)  In addition, we had a video chat with my mother in law with this baby at the gender reveal baby shower, and she posted some stupid picture she found, on facebook for all her friends to see, before I even got home from the shower (not a picture of our cake or anything, since there weren't any pictures yet...). I looked at the time stamp, did the math and figured out she had done it immediately. I confronted her about it, she deleted it, and still didn't re-share the picture that I had posted. Damage was done anyway.  Yeah, neither of them are knowing we're in labor until the baby is born, and they are not getting pictures until I post them myself. Remember, if they do it once, they'll probably do it again.""",0

"""&gt; Tennessee accepts New York marriages as legitimate and the new york married couple has all the rights and privileges of a Tennessee marriage when in the state of Tennessee.  Yes, this is correct. That is the point that Roberts was attempting to make. So long as the New York marriage was legal at the time it was formalized in New York, Tennessee accepts it as legal when the couple moves to the state and affords the couple all the rights of marriage in Tennessee.  But Roberts asked why a gay couple (who were married New York) are treated differently from a straight couple (who were married New York) upon moving to Tennessee. Think of this hypothetical:  You are a Tennessee employer who is reviewing marriage licenses for the purpose of spousal health insurance. There is a new employee, Adam, who is married to Taylor. They recently moved from New York.  The marriage license is legitimate, so why should you treat it differently if Adam is married to Taylor Swift versus Taylor Lautner? By denying health insurance to Taylor Lautner, you are effectively retroactively applying Tennessee marriage laws to a New York couple. That is improper under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  &gt; This is why marriage sinks to the least common denominator.   Marriage has always flowed to the lowest common denominator. That is why Las Vegas became a mecca for quickie, drunk marriages. There is no requirements about waiting periods or blood tests or counseling.  It is also why Scalia and Roberts hinted that they could rule against Question 1 but rule in favor of Question. It would create an exception that swallows the rule.  &gt; If California were to institute a single party initiated no-fault divorce without residence requirements that ignored pre-nups, then every marriage across the country would now be subject to that ""free divorce.""   This forum shopping already occurs in divorce cases though. That is why there is a whole cottage industry dedicated to choice-of-law questions with respect the divorce. One real world example is Katie Holmes divorcing Tom Cruise:  &gt; When Katie Holmes filed for divorce from Tom Cruise, she made a strategic move by choosing to file in New York rather than California.  &gt; New York is a good state to file in for parents who are looking for sole legal custody of their child—as Holmes is, according to TMZ. California is more likely to offer shared custody. (However, filing for divorce could be bad for Cruise since he has been trying to avoid the high tax rates in the city.)  http://laist.com/2012/06/30/katie_holmes_tom_cruise.php  &gt; So this notion that there is any kind of guarantee that ones marital rights will be protected outside of the state is a legal fiction.   But it is a legal fiction that has been consistently applied to all straight couples getting married. Suddenly when gay couples could get married too, states dedicated to stop the uniform applicable of the legal fiction. Such an abrupt change in state behavior signals a discriminatory purpose to the courts. (It was the basis for ""Windsor"" where the federal government had accepted any and all state marriages, but suddenly changed this practice when same sex marriage started.)""",0

"""Posting for the sake of misinformation which is rampant here. ""How long are you supposed to wait until you should get tested I believe it's two weeks, but I'm nervous wondering if that's too early?"" First off let's address this, there a lot of different types of HIV tests. The first which detects HIV the earliest post exposure is an HIV RNA test. This test has a high false readings rates which is why its seldomly ever used. The second earliest is a 4th generation HIV test which are very accurate now and have around a 90% success rate at 2 weeks post exposure(I recommend this test to ease your mind due to its early test time and high success rate.) The most common are 3rd generation HIV tests which are nearly 100% accurate at 6 weeks post exposure. None of these numbers are at 100% for 2 reasons, one to address possible failures in the test itself and two to address people who seroconvert later than others. Everyone who isn't heavily immuno-compromised will be detectable at 8 weeks on a third generation test, but I still follow CDC recommendations of follow up testing at 3 months to further confirm earlier tests. Note that this follow up test does not mean you will be HIV positive at 3 months you most surely will not as this is just a safety measure to get rid of those pesky .0000001% chances of test failures(which are mainly just statistical backlash anyways.) TL;DR on testing etiquette: RNA test don't do it, 2nd generation do it at 2week post exposure, 3rd generation test at 6 weeks and always test again at 3 months. http://www.rnceus.com/fl2hiv/test2.html source for information above and keep in mind the gaps in stats are to incorporate people who have compromised immune systems such as people on chemo, late stages of cancer, and heavy drug users. The windows of testing are large to make sure that no one slips by due to any matter as it would be negligent to otherwise considering the severity of HIV.  Next on the list the risk: The average per risk of condomless sex from topping a male who is infected with HIV is .03%. Yes it really is that low, HIV's ability to infect is very low as it infects a very specific and hard to find cell that it has to just bump into aswell as considering that HIV is extremely fragile. The virus dies near instantly upon exposure to oxygen and the viral amount needed to infect is roughly 2 million units of HIV(to put this into perspective the highest HIV amount the largest mosquito can carry from feeding off an AIDS infected patient is roughly 1,000 units which is near a full ounce of HIV infected blood from the highest concentration naturally possible. You can begin to see why HIV has a low infection rate and this isn't even taking into consideration the effect that the mucous membrane plays in your urethra in preventing HIV from passing into your body. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS I feel like I have rambled enough. You chances of contracting HIV are very low just test at the above recommendations and test again at 3 months for guidelines sake and in the future take care of yourself, know the risks, be careful, and remember that sex is only a small part of your life that could ruin the rest of it.""",0

Regarding the all-or-nothing Firespray situation, who says everything is handled by the pilot? Why can't more than one person help?

Even if you insist on one crewmember controlling everything, who's to say that the rest of the party can't be backseat drivers? They can make their rolls to come up with suggestions to manage the comms, angle shields, and use other systems, leaving to pilot to only have to input their requests and then focus on their own actions. The pilot should be literally limited to one maneuver and one action, but rather can only himself complete that many tasks; there's nothing saying he can't be doing other things in a round like inputing the actions of the rest of the party.

Lev 17:11: ""For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.""  &gt; It is THE BLOOD that maketh an atonement.  You can make restitution with your fellow man, and repay what you owe, or have transgressed in, but this does not bring atonement. Recompensation covers the GUILT of your offense against your FELLOW MAN. Atonement covers the CONDEMNATION unto death that YHWH has judged you with. You must be forgiven on both accounts. Recompensation is not teshuva. You must also be forgiven by YHWH himself.  Could you show me where in the Torah atonement is made without a life being given for your own? Sin brings death. When you sin, you are worthy of death, and blood must be shed, this is a Torah principle, and it is immutable. How do you gain atonement without temple sacrifice?

Almost no lies are truly flat on the course, and of course don't forget about rough and hazards. Certainly not least, is short game/approach.

I've been taking siladenifil but am planning on getting tadalafil as it's got a longer half-life.  As far as whether it's worth it... I'd say it all depends on how cheap you can get it, and what your significant other/children situation is.  IIRC the TD trestolone base I used was priced at ~$80 for 3g TD solution, so $26/1g.  It'd be real nice to get some bulk powder, and make your own TD solution, if you can get it cheap enough... I talked a source down to $36 a gram shipped and that's nowhere near where it needs to be, to be cost-effective.  Compare that to the popular source of pre-prepared trestolone acetate in GSO, which I believe sells at $36/1g on sale, $50/1g not on sale.  GSO compared to TD comes out to be about even if you figure the TD solution is absorbing at 50% at best, which is the unsupported-in-data impression I have.

"""So, in Golarion there's this path of souls... or a river of souls... some large contiguous body of all of the dead souls from forever. And they lead to Pharasma's place in the multiverse. (The Boneyard? Something like that.) And she's... processing them? Look, this stuff is complicated, just bear with me.  So Pharasma has a line of souls going for a long damned time. Lots of dead people, apparently. And on the other end of the line is a thing. I dunno what it's called, but it's bad. It's a bad thing. Really, it's The Bad Thing. When The Bad Thing gets to the front of the line and into The Boneyard the universe ends. Or maybe all life as we know it is extinguished, or the Abyss crashed into the Astral Plane. I forget exactly, but it's bad for everyone. Like, multi-versally bad.  Okay, so Pharasma-souls-souls-souls-souls-The Bad Thing. So what? Well, raising the dead pulls a soul out of line. The more dead you raise, the more souls (or soul energy, or what have you) you pull out of line. Since the souls are pretty literally staving off the heat death of the Universe pulling them out of line is bad.  Creating undead makes everyone (in the truly universal sense of the word) that much closer to planar catastrophy, up to and possibly including having every molecule in your body exploding outwards simultaneously at the speed of light and the frogurt being cursed. That's bad. Like... hastening the end times is actually, objectively, evil. Capital Evil even. The gods themselves have so spoken.  In not-Golarion? The disrespect and desecration thing. Possibly because a god says so.  &gt;I'd like to focus more on the necromancy side of things...  &gt;Does anyone have any suggestions of cool things I can pull off without being cast out of society (again)?

"""Ok, so your Body Mass Index (BMI) is 31.6. Normal weight is 18-25, overweight is 25 to 30, and obese is over 30.   I am going to assume for these calculations you are 25 years old. If you are lightly active around the house all day, then you burn about 2200 calories per day. If you limit those calories to 1700 per day (a 500 calorie deficit), then you will lose 1 lb per week. If you want to lose 2 lbs per week, you will need to cut back further to 1200 calories per day.  Of those 1700 calories, you will want to make sure that you get an adequate amount of protein and fat since they will make you feel more full than sugary carbohydrates.  Right now, you are eating a lot of rice and bread which is mostly carbohydrates, and the fruit you are eating (the dates and banana) are sugary compared to, for example, an apple or berries. You might want to steer away from this, but I understand if your food budget would not allow it. """,0
